      <abstract label="Abstract:">Founded in 1920, the League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan
        political organization that informs citizens about government, encourages their
        participation, and seeks to influence public policy through education and advocacy. One of
        nearly 60 local leagues in New York State, the League of Women Voters of Saratoga County
        (formerly the League of Women Voters, Saratoga Springs Area) formed in early 1965. This
        collection documents the operation and activities of this local league from its founding
        through 2010.</abstract>

      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The (National) League of Women Voters (LWV) was founded by Carrie Chapman Catt in 1920
        during the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The convention
        was held just six months before the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified,
        giving women the right to vote after a 72-year struggle.</p>
      <p>The League began as a "mighty political experiment" designed to help 20 million women carry
        out their new responsibilities as voters. It encouraged them to use their new power to
        participate in shaping public policy. From the beginning, the League has been an activist,
        grassroots organization whose leaders believed that citizens should play a critical role in
        advocacy. The League is proud to be nonpartisan, neither supporting nor opposing candidates
        or political parties at any level of government, but always working on vital issues of
        concern to members and the public.</p>
      <p>The League, now open to men and women, has 150,000 plus members, and supporters in the
        U.S., with Leagues in every state, Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., the Virgin Islands and
        Hong Kong. Statewide in New York, there are nearly 60 local leagues with approximately 8000
        members.</p>
      <p>The Saratoga County Chapter was founded in 1965, as a "provisional league," under the name
        of League of Women Voters of the Saratoga Springs Area. At the time, with the exception of
        Saratoga Springs, most of Saratoga County consisted of small towns and farming areas, with
        some residents of the southern portion of the county having closer ties to the Schenectady
        County Chapter of the league. Thus it was decided to make Saratoga Springs the hub of this
        new chapter, specifically including the towns of Saratoga Springs, Wilton and Greenfield. To
        fulfill national requirements, a thorough study of the community was prepared early in 1965,
        and members were recruited to meet the 25 member minimum. The chapter was granted authority
        from the national organization in early 1965, and had its first organizational meeting on
        April 8, 1965. A membership total of 59 was reported at the April 28, 1965 board meeting. In
        April, 1967 the organization was granted "full league" status.</p>
      <p>In 1999, with the demise of the Southern Saratoga County LWV (previously know as the
        Shenendehowa LWV), it was decided to apply for expansion to include the whole county in the
        organization. Permission was granted by the national LWV on February 17, 2000 for the name
        change to League of Women Voters of Saratoga County (LWVSC). Members of disbanded chapters
        were invited to join. (Records of the LWV of Southern Saratoga County are not included in
        the collection.)</p>
      <p>Since 2000, the LWVSC has expanded its activities and membership to serve the whole county.
        The 2010-2011 membership list includes approximately 160 members.</p>
      <p>The stated mission of the LWVSC, like its parent organization, is as follows: The League of
        Women Voters, a nonpartisan political organization, encourages informed and active
        participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues,
        and influences public policy through education and advocacy.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains the records of the League of Women Voters of Saratoga County
        (LWVSC), from its founding in 1965 through 2010. It documents the organization's internal
        functioning and its public activities during that time. Included are the administrative
        documents of the chapter: by-laws and revisions, membership and officer lists, annual
        reports, annual meeting program information, some correspondence, budget and financial
        statements, monthly meeting minutes, and monthly member bulletins (newsletters). Information
        on the work of the chapter in education, outreach and advocacy projects is detailed by
        project, and includes meeting notes, studies, reports, surveys, photographs and news
        clippings. In addition to the newsletters, there are various other publications the league
        sponsored. Also included are a small number of videotapes, mainly of local "Meet the
        Candidate" events.</p>
      <p>While records of the disbanded LWV of Southern Saratoga County are not included in the
        collection, the Project and Subject Files contain a few projects in which this group
        participated, and a Clifton Park-Halfmoon Community Study from 1971, apparently prepared for
        purposes of securing provisional league status for that organization.</p>
      <p>The archivist retained file titles created by the League of Women Voters of Saratoga
        County.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Files series consists of organizational records which document the
            activities of the Board of Directors. These include founding documents, by-laws and
            changes, annual reports to the national organization, monthly meeting minutes, and event
            programs from annual chapter meetings. Budgets, treasurer reports and event calendars
            are mainly interfiled with meeting minutes, as is some correspondence. There are gaps in
            some months and years. Files labeled "Other" contain a mixture of items, including
            correspondence, budgets, pamphlets, Voters Guides, annual program calendar flyers and
            study reports.</p>

          <p>This series consists mainly of the monthly bulletins that were sent to LWVSC members
            and select members of the public. Each one contains a message from the President,
            information about chapter events, as well as state and national LWV news and
            conventions. They also inform members of meetings, candidate events, studies and
            advocacy projects and voter registration information. There are some missing months.
            Other publications in this series are Community Guides, Voters Guides and various
            booklets and pamphlets.</p>
