      <p> All items in this manuscript group were lent to the University Libraries, M.E.

      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>A labor council was organized in Glens Falls, NY, in 1901. The first 
  AFL-CIO charter was issued for the council in 1959. At this time, the 
  organization was called the Glens Falls, New York, Trades &amp; Labor Assembly, 
  AFL-CIO. The charter was amended in 1969 when the labor council became 
  the Greater Glens Falls, New York, Central Labor Council. However, the 
  council continued to use the name Glens Falls Trades &amp; Labor Council at 
  least through 1979. </p>
      <p>In the mid-1980's, the labor council initiated a drive to reinvigorate itself, 
  especially by increasing the number of its affiliates. The council was 
  not always successful in convincing labor union locals to join; nevertheless, 
  its growth was quite rapid. A merger between the Glens Falls Central Labor 
  Council and that for Saratoga County was considered in the 1980's, but the president 
  of the Glens Falls council announced in 1988 that the merger was no longer being 
  contemplated, ostensibly because the Glens Falls council had had the "largest 
  growth of any council in the U.S." and had no need to merge. </p>
      <p>As with any labor council, the Greater Glens Falls Central Labor Council is 
  a group of labor union locals which have joined together to share information 
  about labor activities (especially in their area) and to develop strategies 
  for coordinated union action. Activities of the labor council include 
  picketing assistance in the Glens Falls area, coordinating political action, 
  and lending moral and financial support to labor union locals on strike. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Merely the last dozen or so years of the Glens Falls Central Labor Council 
  are documented by minutes, and the years with minutes often have significant 
  gaps until the mid-1980's. However, the labor council sometimes canceled 
  its December meeting, so the lack of a December meeting does not necessarily 
  represent a gap. </p>
      <p>Best documented in these records is the rise of this labor council from a small 
  and virtually dormant labor council into an expanding and politically active 
  council. The methods used by the labor council to achieve advances towards 
  its goals become obvious: these primarily consist of contacts with politicians, 
  the media, and other labor union organizations. As the council expanded, 
  its reach expanded, so that it was not just interested in local and regional 
  matters (though those predominate), but also was often actively helping locals 
  across the country. </p>
      <p>These copies of the records of the Greater Glens Falls Central Labor Council 
  were photocopied onto acid-free paper from the originals held by the labor council. 
  The originals were returned to the labor council. </p>
