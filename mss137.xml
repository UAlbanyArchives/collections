      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Geof Huth is an artist and archivist who was born in 1960 in Burlingame, California. He spent the vast majority of his childhood living overseas on four continents and in nine countries. He has lived in California, Virginia, Portugal, Canada, the District of Columbia, Barbados, Bolivia, Ghana, Morocco, Tennessee, Somalia, Germany, and New York. He has also traveled extensively in South America, Europe, Africa, and the United States. He learned to read and write Portuguese and German before he learned English, but he eventually lost the use of both languages. He currently reads, writes, and speaks French and Spanish to some degree.</p>
      <p> His first school was the Deutsche Schule zu Porto, the German school of Oporto, Portugal, where the languages of instruction were German and Portuguese. He attended fifteen schools across the world before he graduated from Father Ryan High School in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1978. He graduated with a BA in English from Vanderbilt University in 1982, received an MA in Creative Writing from Syracuse University in 1986, and earned a Master of Library Science from the University at Albany in 1989. He married Nancy Anne Frye in 1984, and they have two children, Erin and Timothy.</p>
      <p> Huth began writing short stories, poetry, and commonplace books when he was a child. In college, he began producing other kinds of art, including films, photography, and other visual art. He has been active in the international visual poetry field since 1985, and has produced a wide variety of language-based art since that time, including poetry, visual poetry, fiction, essays, and creative dictionaries. Huth is a well known authority on visual poetry and has spent years writing visual poetry criticism and theory, most of it published to his weblog, <emph render="italic">dbqp: visualizing poetics</emph>.</p>
      <p> Starting in 1987, Huth became an active micropublisher, releasing small publications in small editions, first through his micropress dbqp, which publishes language, visual, and conceptual poetry, comics, prose, and other artistic and usually minimalist works. The press publishes a number of different series and magazines, including <emph render="italic">Alabama Dogshoe Moustache</emph> (an irregular poetry journal); <emph render="italic">Socks, Dregs and Rocking Chairs</emph> (an occasional comic book); <emph render="italic">The Subtle Journal of Raw Coinage</emph> (a once-monthly magazine printing undefined invented words from antiquity to the present), and <emph render="italic">A Voice Without Sides</emph> (a limited edition magazine of all types of art, published in exotic ways). Begun in 1989, pdqp, the sister press to dbqp, publishes works primarily related to Huth's family (such as the family's annual holiday cards) and short runs of works by Huth himself (such as programs for his poetry readings). Involved in mailart for years, Huth has released most of his mailart under the qbdp imprint since 2004. He also produces unique bookworks (including diaries, notebooks, and artist's books) under the imprint bqpd.</p>
      <p> By 2003, most of Huth's artistic output became focused on the World Wide Web. He began to produce <emph render="italic">dbqp: visualizing poetics</emph>, a daily weblog on the topic of verbo-visual art in general and visual poetry in particular. He also began to produce other weblogs, including one on mailart (<emph render="italic">qbdp: the mailartworks</emph>) and a daily blog of observational prose poems (<emph render="italic">One Million Footnotes</emph>). Many of his works, particularly those digital works that cannot exist on paper, continue to be published on the Web, in e-zines, blogzines, and websites.</p>
      <p> Huth has also been active professionally in archives and records management and has served as the executive officer of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference, the Lake Ontario Archives Conference (now the New York Archives Conference), Capital Area Archivists of New York, and the Albany Chapter of the Association of Records Managers and Administrators (now referred to simply as ARMA). He has also chaired the Electronic Records and Government Records sections of the Society of American Archivists. Huth regularly speaks on archives and records management, particularly electronic records, across the country. He currently is the Director of Government Records Services at the New York State Archives.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The majority of these papers focus on Geof Huth's artistic activities: his creation of artworks, his involvement in the fields of visual and experimental poetry, his productions as a micropublisher, and his work as an active blogger in the worldwide network of online poets. Although Huth began writing poetry and short stories as a child, few of these works survive. His frequent moves during his childhood were opportunities for discarding unnecessary materials such as drafts of writing. Huth's records provide good documentation of the interrelated international fields of visual poetry, experimental poetry, and mailart from the 1980s until the present. Huth's papers include a wide range of media, including broadsides and other large-format paper publications, books, videotapes, audiotapes, electronic media, and super-8 and 16mm films. Huth has created a wide range of artistic and literary works, including very early digital poems written in Apple BASIC and still readable via Apple II emulator software. The bulk of Huth's creative works range from the mid-1980s until the present.</p>
      <p> The papers also document Huth's personal life, including his school career, travels, family, and friendships. Through various records, including newspaper clippings, his biographical records provide information about his personal activities as a child and an adult. His correspondence provides sometimes detailed information about his life, art, and relationships, and his weblogs provide much detail about his life and biography.</p>
      <p> Finally, these papers document Huth's career in archives and records management. The association records in his biographical files document the archives and records management profession and Geof Huth's role in various associations in New York State and across the country. His work records document his presentations across the country and his various professional positions. These records also include copies of publications and articles written by Huth.</p>
      <p> The primary language of these records is English, but other languages present in these papers include Danish, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Somali, and Spanish.</p>

          <p>This series documents the micropress dbqp and includes final copies of publications (usually two of each), business records for dbqp, and layouts for dbqp publications. Larger object dbqp publications are stored separately. The micropress dbqp publishes a number of different series and magazines, including Alabama Dogshoe Moustache (an irregular poetry journal); Buried Tongue (a gallery of verbo-visual art compiled with a different co-editor/publisher for each issue); Epistulational Exscrapts (a magazine publishing excerpts from personal letters); Foolscap (an occasional broadsheet of reviews and essays); Socks, Dregs and Rocking Chairs (an occasional comic book); The Subtle Journal of Raw Coinage (a once-monthly magazine printing undefined invented words from antiquity to the present); and A Voice Without Sides (a limited edition magazine of all types of art, published in wildly exotic manners). The press also publishes leaflets (in the series &amp;, CHRON, and QCXK), postcards (dbqprescards), chapbooks (goodbooqpres), and semiotic objects (Objecta).</p>

          <p>This series documents pdqb, a personal micropress that publishes documentation of Geof Huth's family (such as the family's annual holiday cards) and short runs of visual and conceptual poetry by Geof Huth. The press also publishes some work by other artists in Film Clips, a mailart magazine. The name "pdqb" can stand for "pretty damn quick books", although that is not its official name. The series includes final copies of pdqb publications (usually two of each), administrative records for pdqb, and layouts for pdqb publications. Unlike dbqp publications, pdqb publications are rarely sold and meant to be given away for free. The original issues of eXmaSscard (the family's series of holiday cards) were originally released as issues of dbqp but have since 1989 been released under the pdqb imprint.</p>

          <p>The micropress qbdp releases only tiny runs of mailart. The series includes single copies of the mailart produced by Geof Huth in the qbdp series and occasional copies of layouts for same. The micropress qbdp was officially initiated in May 2004, when Huth began to produce mailart in small editions, saving one copy of each for his files. The original issues of Film Clips, the mailart zine originally released by pdqb were retronumbered as the first numbers of qbdp, and issues from Film Clips are now released only under the qbdp imprint.</p>

          <p>Starting at the end of 2003, much of Geof Huth's artistic output was focused on his work on weblogs. This series consists of paper and electronic copies of the various weblogs produced by Huth, one of which is a joint blog with D. Ross Priddle. This series includes blog files (archived copies of each blog), electronic files (copies of the electronic files used to created the blogs), and paper files (printouts of the weblogs).</p>

            <p>This weblog documented the remodeling of Geof and Nancy Huth's home from February until July 2006. The blog includes numerous digital photographs and some digital video. A daily blog recounting the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of remodeling too much of the home of the GNET Huth family (with the E of GNET only rarely in evidence). We take as our governing principle this quotation by T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings: 'The surroundings householders crave are glorified autobiographies' (the full version of which appears at the bottom of this page)". URL: http://huthhouse.blogspot.com</p>
