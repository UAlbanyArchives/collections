      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Julius Volker was born in 1903 in Lancaster, New York. He received a bachelor of arts degree from
     	Canisius College in 1924 and a bachelor of laws degree from Buffalo Law School in 1927. Volker was 
		commissioned to the New York State Bar later that year. In 1931 he married Loretta O'Neill and
		together they raised two sons.</p>
      <p>From 1934-1935 Volker served as a councilman for the town of Lancaster and was is justice of the
        peace from 1936-1939. Volker then served as town attorney from 1940-1941 and again in 1946. With
        other local leders and supporters, Volker helped to create the Lancaster Town Police Ambulance
        Service in 1953, the first volunteer ambulance service in Western New York and the first in the
		state to be operated by and within a police department.</p>
      <p>In 1945, voters elected Volker to the New York State Assembly as the Republican representative
        from Erie County 7th district and he remained in that position until 1965. In 1966 Volker served an
        additional year in the New York Assembly as the Republician representative from Erie County 162nd
        district. During his tenure in the New York State Assembly Volker was chairman of the Committee on
        Codes and chairman of the Committee on Aviation and Insurance.</p>
      <p>Following his retirement from the Assembly, Julius Volker maintained a law practice in Buffalo. He
        passed away approximately ten years later. One of Volker's sons, Dale Volker, was elected to the
        New York State Assembly in 1972 and became a New York State Senator three years later. He announced
        his intended retirement from the Senate in May 2010.</p>
