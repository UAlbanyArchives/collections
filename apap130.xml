      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Sierra Club (http://www.sierraclub.org) is a national environmental organization
                founded in California in 1892 by naturalist and explorer John Muir with the mission
                to "explore, enjoy and protect the wild places of the earth" [Sierra Club. Accessed
                May 11, 2005 [http://www.sierraclub.org]. The Atlantic Chapter is responsible for
                the Sierra Club's membership and activities in New York, and deals with a variety of
                environmental issues in the state, such as land use controls, pollution, recycling,
                and endangered species and habitat protection. First formed in 1950, the Atlantic
                Chapter originally spanned the entire eastern seaboard, but several new state
                organizations were formed in the 1960s and early 1970s, and from 1972 on, the name
                "Atlantic Chapter" was restricted to just New York [Information on the early
                Atlantic Chapter is found in S. Ogilvy and J. Nunn, "Sierra Club expansion and
                evolution: The Atlantic Chapter, 1957-1969", in Sierra Club History Committee, <emph render="italic">The Sierra Club Nationwide: Interviews</emph>. San Francisco,
                CA: Sierra Club History Committee, 1983]. Further information about the Sierra Club
                Atlantic Chapter can be found at http://newyork.sierraclub.org. This collection
                contains the records of the Atlantic Chapter from the mid-1960s through the
                1990s.</p>
      <p>The Atlantic Chapter, headquartered in Albany since 1978, has devoted much of its
                energy to battling what it regards as environmentally unsound development projects,
                and to cleaning up or eliminating pollution. In the late 1960s and 1970s the chapter
                fought the proposed nuclear power plant at Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River
                and the proposed Westway Highway in Manhattan, was involved in the exposure of the
                toxic contamination at Love Canal, raised concerns about construction at the Lake
                Placid Olympic site, and issued warnings about PCBs in the Hudson River and acid
                rain. The 1980s was a mixed decade for the Chapter. It racked up a number of
                successes, such as taking part in the petition drive to remove James Watt as U.S.
                Secretary of the Interior, lobbying for beverage container recycling, supporting the
                election of Mario Cuomo as New York governor (though later disagreeing with him on a
                number of issues), fighting to protect the Lake Minnewaska/Shawangunk Mountains
                area, and successfully campaigning for passage of the Environmental Quality Bond Act
                of 1986. But the Chapter also suffered financial and ethical problems. Expenses
                early in the decade far exceeded income, resulting in a debt of $60,000 by 1983,
                which forced the national organization to put the Chapter into trusteeship in 1987.
                The Atlantic Chapter was also plagued by infighting, accusations of rigged
                elections, and the embarrassing discovery that the Chapter's delegate to the Sierra
                Club Council, Walter Blank, had been illegally dumping toxic chemicals from his pest
                control business. The Chapter recovered in the 1990s and undertook some of its most
                intense activity ever, pushing for passage of the unsuccessful Environmental Quality
                Bond Act of 1990, urging environmentally sound land use policies in the Adirondack
                Park, and taking part in the widespread opposition to the James Bay hydroelectric
                project. The Chapter opposed the candidacy of George Pataki for New York governor,
                but later developed an uneasy working relationship with him after his election. The
                Chapter supported Pataki on some issues, while opposing him on a number of other
                initiatives such as regulatory reform and budget and personnel cuts at the
                Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
      <p>Based upon chapter directories from 1988-1993, the Atlantic Chapter in the early
                1990s was structured as follows. The statewide organization was headed by four
                officers: the chair, vice-chair, secretary, and treasurer. Chairs of the Atlantic
                Chapter have included Alfred Forsyth (?-1972), Ted Hullar (1972-?), Irven Rinard
                (?-1978), Samuel Sage (1978-1984), Pam Woywood (1984-1986), Al Hauser (1986-1987?),
                Jim Carr (1987-1988), Rich Fedele (1988-1991), Don Young (1991-?), and Ken Baer
                (?-Present). There was also a Board of Governance consisting of twenty-seven
                members, eighteen of whom represented particular regional groups, while nine were
                at-large members. Nine members of the Board of Governance made up the Executive
                Committee. Four people served as delegates to larger Sierra Club bodies: three to
                the (Northeast) Regional Conservation Committee, and one to the Sierra Club Council.
                The state organization further consisted of administrative committees and
                conservation committees. The eighteen administrative committees handled the various
                operational concerns of the chapter. These committees were: Archives, By-laws,
                Compliance Officer, Computer, Consumer Education, Elections, Environmental
                Education, Financial Affairs, Fundraising, Honors and Awards, Legal, Newsletter
                Editor, Nominating, Office and Personnel, Outings, Political, Publications Rep, and
                Training Coordinator. The sixteen conservation committees dealt with specific
                environmental issues at the state level. These committees were: Adirondacks,
                Catskills, Energy, Great Lakes, Industrial Pre-Treatment, International, James Bay
                Defense, Ozone, Pesticides, Population, Public Lands, Solid Waste,
                Toxics/Radioactive Waste, Transportation, Water Resources, and Wildlife/Wilderness,
                plus a Conservation Chair and Vice-Chair.</p>
      <p>The Atlantic Chapter divided New York State into eleven regional groups, which dealt
                with local environmental issues, possessed their own internal organization, issued
                their own newsletters, and sent representatives to the state Board of Governance.
                The regional groups in 1993 were: Finger Lakes, Hudson-Mohawk, Iroquois, Long
                Island, Lower Hudson (aka Westchester/Putnam), Mid-Hudson, New York City, Niagara,
                Ramapo-Catskill, Rochester, and Susquehanna.</p>
      <p>The Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter, as of 2005,consists of three paid staff members-the
                chapter legislative director, the chapter legislative associate, and the chapter
                coordinator-and the volunteer leaders, of which there are five officers (chair,
                vice-chair, secretary, treasurer, and conservation chair) and twenty-four
                conservation issue chairs. The chairs cover the following issues: Air Quality,
                Airports, Adirondacks, Biodiversity/Earth Diet, Energy, Environmental Education,
                Environmental Justice, Farm and Food, Global Warming, Great Lakes, International
                Population, Legislative, Open Space, Shawangunks, Sprawl, Sterling Forest/Highlands,
                St. Lawrence Cement Plant Task Force, Superfund/Brownfields, Sustainable Forestry,
                Solid Waste, Toxic Waste, Wetlands, Wildlife and Wilderness. The Sierra Club
                Atlantic Chapter currently possesses a membership of about 40,000.</p>

          <p>This series consists of materials relating directly to the operations of the
                        Atlantic Chapter. There is one folder of items covering the late 1960s
                        through the 1970s (General Records, 1967-1979), but most of the series dates
                        from the 1980s and 1990s. The records of important chapter bodies such as
                        eight of the eighteen administrative committees, the Board of Governance,
                        and the Executive Committee are included here, and there are lists of
                        chapter members and officers. Other items found in the series include budget
                        materials, by-laws, fundraising letters, general correspondence, and

            <p>The conservation committees were part of the statewide organization which
                            focused on a particular environmental issue, such as James Bay or solid
                            waste, that was dealt with statewide. Seven of the eighteen committees
                            listed in the 1993 Chapter Directory (Adirondack, Conservation, Energy,
                            Public Lands, Radioactive Waste, Solid Waste, and Water Resources) are

            <p>The regional groups were the geographic subdivisions of the Atlantic
                            Chapter which handled issues of primarily local interest, for example,
                            contaminated waste sites in particular communities. Items typically
                            found in the regional group records include by-laws, membership
                            information, correspondence, minutes of meetings, financial data, and
                            newsletters. All of the eleven regional groups listed in the 1993

          <p>This series documents the Atlantic Chapter's various activities in the
                        political process at the state and national levels. Included here are
                        materials relating to its efforts to influence the 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993,
                        1994, 1996, and 1998 elections, such as endorsements and voter guides. The
                        1990, 1992, and 1994 elections are the most extensively documented. Other
                        political activities the Atlantic Chapter engaged in include lobbying the
                        New York State Legislature, tracking national political events (such as the
                        Republican takeover of Congress in 1994), contributing to the revision of
                        New York City's charter in 1989, and general grassroots activities. Also
                        included are Atlantic Chapter documents relating to election law compliance
                        and an electoral activity handbook for Sierra Club activists. There is also
                        documentation of the offices, agencies, and initiatives of New York State
                        government, including materials regarding Governors Mario Cuomo and George
                        Pataki, the Legislature, the Department of Environmental Conservation,
                        regulatory changes undertaken by Governor Pataki, and the State
                        Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA).</p>

          <p>This series documents the Atlantic Chapter's efforts to stop the proposed
                        hydroelectric project near James Bay in northern Quebec in the early 1990s.
                        Hydro-Quebec, the province's public electrical utility, intended to build a
                        series of hydroelectric stations on the Great Whale River (Fr. <emph render="italic">Grande Baleine</emph>), and sell the electricity
                        produced in the United States, particularly to New York and Vermont. This
                        was the second phase of a larger project dating back to 1971. The project
                        involved flooding a large area of northern Quebec, which opponents claimed
                        would have drowned the breeding grounds of several wildlife species,
                        released deposits of mercury into the environment, and disrupted the
                        subsistence habits of the Cree Indians of Quebec. New York State signed two
                        contracts with Hydro-Quebec for James Bay electricity, one for 800 megawatts
                        (MW) and the other for 1000MW in 1989. Efforts by the Sierra Club and other
                        organizations to cancel the contracts began almost immediately, and the
                        project gained wide media attention by 1991-1992, due in part to publicity
                        tours by the Quebec Cree and Inuit in the United States. The contracts were
                        cancelled in 1992 and 1994. Items found in the series include papers by
                        various American and Canadian environmental organizations, materials
                        relating to the two contracts, items by and about the Cree Indians of
                        Quebec, Hydro-Quebec documents (including the complete twenty-seven volume
                        Grande Baleine Complex feasibility study, and a study of the related Sainte
                        Marguerite-3 hydroelectric project), economic and ecological studies, and
                        relevant New York State documents.</p>
