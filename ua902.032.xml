      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Theodore Fossieck was the principal of Milne from 1948-1972, and therefore, spanned many years as the chief administrator. He was very active in school functions and was liked by the students, based on his presence at many school reunions after the closing of Milne. He retired in 1972, amidst the pressure on the school to accept more diverse applicants, as well as severe budget cuts in the SUNY system that would lead to the closing of the Milne school in 1977.</p>
      <p>Even after his departure as principal, Fossieck remained active among the Milne School Alumni. He atteneded many reunions, along with other faculty members, and kept in tocuh with many students.  He retained many student records such as class rankings and yearbooks. Fossieck remained in Albany helping to preserve local history as a member of the Board of Trustees for the Albany County Historical Society. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains materials donated by Dr. Theodroe Fossieck, former principal of The Milne School from 1948-1972. In it are materials not directly related to the administration of the school, but dealing more with events after his resignation from the position of principal. Donated were select copies of the yearbook, "Bricks and Ivy," dating between 1947 and 1977, as well as student file cards containing names of past students and their former home addreses. Many of them are undated, but those that are date to Fossieck's years as principal from 1948-1972. </p>
      <p>The last piece donated are the files Fossieck kept related to the various reunions of Milne Alumni that he attended. Each file contains materials such as invitations, newsletters reporting the status of former class members, as well as the class ranking of each group along with their GPA.  </p>
