      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Robert Rienow was born in Grafton, Wisconsin on December 4, 1907, and later in life married Leona Train, a writer of children's books and articles, and his occasional co-author. After a year at West Point, Rienow continued his education at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1930. His first job was as a school principal at a small school in Wisconsin. Rienow went on to earn advanced degrees from Columbia University in the field of international law and government (M.A., 1933; Ph.D., 1937). While obtaining his master's degree, he taught for one year at Union College in Schenectady, New York. Rienow was also the recipient of Columbia University's Gilder Fellowship in Public Law. In 1935, Rienow attended Ohio State University as part of a research fellowship. ["Rienow to Discuss National Doctrine, Re-sing Scheduled", Unidentified News Clipping, 5 December 1947]. His Ph.D. dissertation was titled "The Test of the Nationality of a Merchant Vessel". While Rienow was completing his Ph.D. at Columbia he served as an Instructor of Political Science in the Social Sciences Department at the New York State College for Teachers, which later became the State University of New York at Albany and is presently known as the University at Albany, SUNY. Rienow continued in this position until 1941, when he was promoted to the position of Assistant Professor. Rienow was promoted to Professor in 1947 and held this position until 1980.</p>
      <p>In July of 1943, Rienow took a leave of absence from his teaching position to serve in the United States Army during World War II. Rienow held a Selective Service position as a Classification Specialist, both in the United States and in the Pacific Theater, until 1945, when he was honorably discharged. He ended his career with the United States Army in 1946 at the rank of First Lieutenant in the Adjutant General's Office. Upon his return, Rienow served in the New York State National Guard in the Selective Service branch, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1962, Rienow, along with his unit, received an award on behalf of the National Guard for the superior ratings received by the unit at regular army inspections.</p>
      <p>Rienow was a prolific writer who published books and articles on both political science and environmental issues. The most prominent of these was <emph render="italic">Moment in the Sun</emph> (1967), which he co-authored with his wife. Other significant works were <emph render="italic">Calling All Citizens</emph> (1952), <emph render="italic">New York State and Local Government</emph> (1959), <emph render="italic">Introduction to Government</emph> (1964), <emph render="italic">Our New Life with the Atom</emph> (1959), <emph render="italic">Of Snuff, Sin, and the Senate</emph> (1965), and <emph render="italic">The Lonely Quest</emph> (1966). The final three were co-authored by Rienow and Leona Train Rienow. Rienow also wrote numerous articles, both alone and in collaboration with his wife. Most of these articles expressed concern about environmental issues, though some were humorous or satirical pieces. Rienow's articles were published in magazines such as <emph render="italic">Harper's Weekly</emph>, <emph render="italic">This Week</emph>, the <emph render="italic">American Legion Magazine</emph>, the <emph render="italic">Saturday Review</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Ladies Home Journal</emph>.</p>
      <p>Rienow maintained a vigorous interest in environmental issues throughout his life. A noted speaker, he delivered many lectures and presentations on environmental issues. In the late 1960s he developed a series of broadcasts on the environment in cooperation with the State University of New York at Albany's School of Public Policy. The series, <emph render="italic">Man Against His Environment</emph>, consisted of 28 lectures on topics such as water pollution, wildlife protection, overpopulation and zero population growth, as well as many others.</p>
      <p>Rienow was a member of numerous environmental organizations, including Defenders of Wildlife, the Constitutional Council for Forest Preserves, the Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, and the Albany Environmental Council. He was an officer of the New York Chapter of The Nature Conservancy. Rienow's professional affiliations included the New York State Political Science Association, of which he was elected president in 1955. ["SCT President Heads Political Science Unit", Unidentified News Clipping, April 1955.]</p>
      <p>Robert Rienow died in 1989 as the result of a fire in his home.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The papers in this collection document Rienow's professional career and personal interests. The collection contains personal files such as records relating to his service in both the United States Army and the New York National Guard; tax information; papers written by Rienow while he was in school; and family papers such as deeds. There are also a significant number of correspondence files. Much of the correspondence is with publishers and editors of various magazines and publishing houses. There is also correspondence with fellow members of environmental organizations and other personal correspondence, such as with Erastus Corning II, Mayor of the City of Albany, and fan mail received by Rienow and his wife.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains papers related to Rienow's career at the State University of New York at Albany. These include extensive lecture notes, syllabi, copies of exams and some professional correspondence. Transcripts and some syllabi for the <emph render="italic">Man Against His Environment</emph> lecture series and a televised political science course called <emph render="italic">Living Patterns of Government</emph> can also be found within the collection. Files related to Rienow's writing career include manuscripts, drafts, and notes on his books and articles. In some cases the printed version of the article is available in the collection through copies of the publication, such as the <emph render="italic">American Legion Magazine</emph>.</p>
      <p>There are also a series of audio tapes from the Center of Cassette Studies on a variety of environmental issues. Many of these tapes contain lectures from the <emph render="italic">Man Against His Environment</emph> series.</p>
      <p>Also significant in the collection are subject files with mailings, notes, publications, photos, and articles on environmental issues, many of which were subjects of articles by Rienow. The subject files include information on organizations such as Defenders of Wildlife, the Nature Conservancy, and Zero Population Growth, as well as topics such as air and water pollution, wildlife protection, overpopulation and zero population growth, forest preservation and the preservation of the Adirondack Mountain region, and the anti-nuclear movement.</p>
      <p>Strengths of the collection include the scripts from television and radio broadcasts; information regarding trends in environmental activism and Rienow's interests in the environmental movement; and the drafts and manuscripts of articles and speeches, many with annotations which illuminate Rienow's writing process.</p>
      <p>Weaknesses of the collection include the lack of material on Rienow's personal life outside of his environmental interests as well as information on and materials from Rienow's life prior to 1960. There are also a significant number of news clippings and notes written on scraps of paper, and their significance is often unclear. Much of Rienow's voluminous correspondence related to his interest in environmental issues was lost in a fire at his home in 1989.</p>
      <p>Researchers should see also the collection of Leona Train Rienow (MSS-025) in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives. Though her collection includes manuscripts of her own publications (children's short stories and novels), it also contains manuscripts of some of her publications on the environment, many of which were written with her husband. This collection also contains correspondence from 1938 to 1963. Related collections can be found in the subject guides for Conservation and the Environment and University at Albany Faculty, Students, and Alumnae.</p>

          <p>In this series are manuscripts and drafts of articles and book chapters written by Rienow, both alone and in cooperation with his wife. In many cases there are multiple drafts of the same article. Many of the drafts include handwritten corrections and annotations by Rienow. These files also include clippings and handwritten notes used in the creation of drafts and manuscripts, as well as occasional correspondence with publishers. Most of the writings relate to Rienow's political science or environmental interests. These include articles on the American standard of living and nuclear fallout, and contributions to the <emph render="italic">Book of Knowledge</emph> and the <emph render="italic">World Book Encyclopedia</emph> on United States government. A number of manuscripts, many of which were co-authored with Leona Train Rienow, are satirical looks at American and European society, including travel articles such as "What! No Lather?" Also found in this series are several drafts of Leona Train Rienow's 1970 novel <emph render="italic">The Year of the Last Eagle</emph>, to which Robert Rienow contributed, as well as a draft of her 1948 novel <emph render="italic">The Bewitched Caverns</emph>.</p>

          <p>This series contains scripts and supporting materials for broadcasts conducted by Rienow. Two lecture series predominate. The first, <emph render="italic">Living Patterns of Government</emph>, was a televised political science course broadcast in early 1958. The second, <emph render="italic">Man Against His Environment</emph>, was a 28 part radio lecture series which addressed a variety of environmental concerns. Topics include air and water pollution, overpopulation, deforestation of the wilderness, and overcrowding in cities. There are also files on other broadcasts by Rienow, such as "The Politics of Survival: The Image of the President.".</p>

          <p>This series is comprised of files on organizations and subjects that were of interest to Rienow. Groups include Defenders of Wildlife, Zero Population Growth, the Nature Conservancy, and Citizens to Save the Adirondack Park. Topics include deforestation and land use, wildlife protection, overpopulation, national wealth, nuclear fallout and the problems of atomic energy, and various forms of pollution. The files contain mostly notes, news clippings, articles, mailings, and publications. There are also files related to government agencies, such as the Department of the Interior and the United States National Treasury. These files consist mainly of government publications on environmental policies and issues, as well as some publications on the structures of the agencies. A few files relate to political science topics.</p>

          <p>This series contains audio tapes of Robert Rienow's lectures, which were produced and distributed by the Center for Cassette Studies. Many of the cassettes are from the <emph render="italic">Man Against His Environment</emph> lecture series. Some were part of other Center for Cassette Studies series, including <emph render="italic">The Ecological Spectrum</emph>. Each tape has a running time of approximately thirty minutes. Also included are case inserts and library cards that were included with each cassette, as well as catalogs of tapes offered by the Center for Cassette Studies. For preservation reasons, the tapes are stored separately from this supplementary material.</p>
