      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p> The State University of New York at Albany Alumni Association was founded in 1849 under
        the name of "The Association of Graduates of the New York Normal School." Its original
        intent was to keep track of the addresses and professions of graduates, and to organize
        support for the school in its dealings with New York State government. Under Corresponding
        Secretary William Phelps the Association started an educational placement bureau to help
        graduates. The Association met biannually and would attempt to meet for "jubilees" and
        reunions. The Association was dormant during the Civil War and not revived till 1872. The
        following year in 1873 the Association adopted a new constitution. In 1890, concurrent with
        the renaming of the school, the Association voted to update the name to "Association of
        Graduates of the New York State Normal School and the New York State Normal College." The
        organization financed and provided information for the first two histories of the school
        published in 1884 and 1895. </p>
      <p> In 1883 the Association took up its first fund-raising effort when the group raised $5,000
        to pay for an "Alumni Memorial Window" for the school’s new Willett Street building. In 1894
        the Association raised funds for a "Soldiers Memorial Tablet" to honor the school's Civil
        War dead, and, after the 1906 fire that destroyed the Willett Street Building, the Memorial
        Window and tablet, the organization engaged in a new campaign for a replacement Soldier’s
        Memorial Tablet. Subsequently the Association raised funds for tablets to honor school World
        War I and World War II dead. Instead of replacing the Alumni Memorial Window, the
        Association chose to raise $10,000 to fund a graduate scholarship in education. The
        fund-raising took over 40 years as the first Albert N. Husted Scholarship was not awarded
        until 1948. In the meantime, during the 1910s and 1920s many individuals and classes
        established Alumni Association small loan funds for students.</p>
      <p>In addition to the main Alumni Association, graduates established regional branches in such
        places as New York City, Long Island, Rochester, Eastern and Western New York, Florida,
        California, and Washington, D.C. These chapters frequently held their own events and
        sponsored activities for alumni in their respective geographic location.</p>
      <p>In 1921 the Association started a Dormitory Committee/Residence Hall Building Fund with the
        goal of raising funds to purchase land and build dormitories with alumni money—Pierce Hall
        for women opened in 1935 and Sayles Hall for men opened in 1941. Fund-raising and the
        purchase of property was carried out through the newly formed Benevolent Association which
        was incorporated in New York in 1926. In 1967 the State of New York purchased those
        dormitories and funds from the purchase were put into alumni funded scholarships. The Alumni
        Association based its operations out of the Benevolent Association office from 1929 until
        1962 when it became part of University Administration.</p>
      <p>There were other substantial fund-raising endeavors carried out by the Alumni Association.
        In 1964 alumni organized to build the symbol of the University's Uptown Campus, the musical
        Carillon. In 1972 the Alumni Association began a drive to build Alumni House, also on the
        new Uptown Campus. The organization also raised money at various times for scholarship
        funds. In 1972 the Alumni Association established the Annual Fund as the main fund-raising
        effort. In 1982 this was transferred to the University at Albany Fund, Inc., created out of
        a merger between the Benevolent Association, the University Foundation and Annual Fund of
        the Alumni Association to serve as one unified University fund-raising operation. </p>
      <p> The Alumni Association updated its name again in 1964 to the University at Albany Alumni
        Association and was incorporated, under Education law 501(c)(3), as a non-profit education
        corporation. </p>
      <p>The collection also documents other initiatives for alumni undertaken by the organization.
        There are publications written for and about alumni, featuring class notes and updates. As
        in earlier periods, the Alumni Association continued to plan Alumni Day and class reunions.
        During the 1970s and 1980s the Alumni office offered travel packages ranging from weekend
        excursions to view foliage in the Adirondacks to multi-week adventures in destinations in
        Europe and Asia. In recent years as the Alumni community grew so did Association
        responsibilities. The organization provides alumni with important business and personal
        connections as well as plans events, such as the Big Purple Growl and Homecoming. The Big
        Purple Growl is a midyear home basketball game that is accompanied by other events,
        including a feast, and heavily attended by alumni. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The State University of New York at Albany Alumni Association Records document the
        day-to-day operations and special event planning of the organization. The Alumni Association
        is a semi-independent, incorporated entity on campus that coordinates alumni outreach and
        supports the University community through fund-raising and advocacy.</p>
      <p>The collection includes meeting minutes and agendas, financial records, correspondence,
        photographs, publications, newspaper clippings, and memorabilia. While the bulk of materials
        dates from the 1960s through the 1980s, there also are notable 19th and early 20th Century
        records, including materials from reunions, correspondence, records of the building of the
        first residence halls, publications, and administrative files.</p>
      <p>Please note that two series contain records of semi-independent organizations directly
        related to alumni and the Alumni Association; the Benevolent Association (Series 6) and the
        Theatre Alumni Association (Series 7). See each series description for additional
        information and history of these groups.</p>

          <p>This series contains materials pertaining to the Board of Directors and the
            administration of the Alumni Association, including founding documents, such as the
            charter and constitution. The earliest Board of Directors meeting minutes are bound
            volumes. By the end of the 1970s the minutes are loose notes belonging to specific
            individuals. The minutes may also include such supplemental materials as correspondence,
            agendas and financial papers. The annual report was available for the Annual Meeting,
            which was open to all Alumni Association members. Financial records for the Alumni
            Association are found in this series in ledgers, financial statements and Treasurer’s
            reports. Loose items from bound volumes have been removed and stored in separate,
            appropriately labeled folders.</p>

          <p>Series 2 contains records related to Alumni Association fund-raising activities. Please
            note that the bulk of the series is from the years 1963-1983 with the further majority
            of this within the decade of the 1970s. </p>
          <p>The earliest fund-raising records are from the first half of the 20th Century and
            address student loan funds and the Husted Fellowship. Materials document who is eligible
            for loans, minutes and activities of the beneficiary aid committee, and contributions to
            the Husted Fellowship. </p>
          <p>Later records from the 1960s document Project Carillon, the fund-raising effort by the
            Alumni Association to build the Carillon tower which has become a symbol of the
            University's Uptown Campus. This includes Project Carillon ledgers, lists of pledges,
            records, events, and general information. The remainder of the series is from the 1970s
            and 1980s and is composed of correspondence, attendance sheets, donor lists, and balance
            sheets relating to the Annual Fund in general and the Phonothon specifically. </p>
          <p>Lists of dues payers and balance sheets relating to income from association dues are
            scattered throughout, as are estate bequests and matching grants. Bequests include
            information of solicitation of retired alumni, a letter from an alumna suggesting such
            an action, and several examples of wills or notices of probates showing the results. The
            matching grants include pamphlets from both the Alumni Association and participating
            companies such as General Electric. There are also lists and records of the alumni who
            qualified and participated in those programs.</p>
          <p>Reports such as “A Study of Attitudes and Funding Potentialities of the State
            University of New York At Albany" and "Visions of Progress" a report conducted by the
            Alumni Association in 1976 on its own efforts may also be found in this series. </p>

          <p>This series document various events and subsidiary organizations of the Alumni
            Association. It is the largest series and records from the 1970-1980s comprise the bulk
            of the material. Two of the major annual events represented in this series are the
            Alumni Day/Weekend and Homecoming. There are materials documenting Alumni Day/Weekend
            for the majority of years between 1919 and 1996. The earlier years may only contain a
            program, while later year may contain correspondence, RSVPs, planning notes and
            photographs. Other events and symposiums are also included in the series. There are
            photographs, correspondence, and planning materials of clubs, committees and local
            branches. Correspondence and day files of Alumni Association staff, awards and
            scholarships processed by the Alumni Association, student directories and tributes to
            University Presidents comprise a substantial portion of the series. The Alumni
            Association offered group travel specials, discounts on insurance and commemorative
            memorabilia. Please note that some of the photographs are oversized.</p>

          <p>This series contains correspondence as well as pamphlets and other materials
            distributed to alumni, predominantly for reunions and other key events. The earliest
            materials are from 19th Century jubilees and reunions of all classes on Alumni Day.
            Later alumni held reunions only for specific classes or campus organizations, such as
            the Potter Club or Pep Band, and this is reflected in the more targeted correspondence.
            Please see Series 1 and Series 3 for more materials related to Alumni Day, and Series 1
            for communication to members of the Eastern Branch of the Alumni Association. The
            correspondence was retained with the group's meeting minutes and is therefore located in
            Administration.</p>
          <p>There also are two publications, <emph render="italic">The Echo</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Alumni Quarterly</emph>, with contributions by, relevant to or about
            alumni. Introduced in 1892 as a monthly publication, <emph render="italic">The
              Echo</emph> was a newspaper/literary magazine featuring short stories and poems by
            current students or alumni as well news updates about the college, faculty, current
            students and alumni. Beginning in 1919, the <emph render="italic">Alumni
              Quarterly</emph> appeared four times a year, once each season. Although it still
            featured written contributions and news about faculty and current students, the emphasis
            shifted to news about and for alumni. The publication sought to bring together graduates
            of "old Normal" (State Normal School), the Normal College and the State College for
            Teachers. The issues included articles about events like Homecoming, contact information
            for key alumni contacts such as the leadership of the Alumni Association and branch
            associaitons and news about alumni jobs, births, marriages and deaths. Although alumni
            always served on the editorial board, by 1933 the publication specifically states that
            it is published by the Alumni Association. <emph render="italic">The Echo</emph>
            continued as a literary magazine and some later issues are included in this series. The
            Alumni Association replaced the <emph render="italic">Alumni Quarterly</emph> with <emph render="italic">The Carillon</emph>, another quarterly alumni publication in Fall 1967
            as a tribute to the Carillon tower built with alumni funds on the University's new
            Uptown Campus.</p>

          <p>This series consists of Alumni Association records related to building dormitories for
            students and the Alumni House Conference Center. Beginning in 1921 the Alumni
            Association created a Dormitory Committee/Residence Hall Building Fund with the goal of
            raising funds to purchase land and build dormitories, especially for women. In 1921 the
            College's only residential building was Syddum Hall, housing 29 female students. The
            great majority of students commuted from home, lived in boarding houses throughout the
            City of Albany, fraternity or sorority houses or at the YWCA. In 1935 Pierce Hall opened
            to house female students and in 1941, Sayles Hall opened for men.</p>
          <p>Many files in this series document this decades-long endeavor to build more college
            dormitories and include committee minutes, reports, correspondence, lists of pledges by
            classes, newsclippings and outreach materials designed to secure financial commitment
            from alumni, students and the community in the funding drive. Professor John Sayles,
            future College president, and Dr. Erastus Corning, a member of the college board of
            trustees, served successive terms as chairs of the Dormitory Committee in the 1920s. The
            City of Albany and its citizens also pledged its support and dollars.</p>
          <p>Of interest to researchers will be the pamphlets and other outreach materials created
            to encourage fund-raising among the various constituencies. An editorial in the <emph render="italic">Alumni Quarterly</emph> written by a member of the Class of 1920
            compares the "meager equipment" and "impossible housing conditions" of State to Vassar
            College. Pamphlets for district chairmen of the fund-raising campaign liken it to a
            machine that must be embolden and put into motion. A newsclipping from 1922 notes how
            members of the Eta Phi sorority will walk home from college that year and instead pledge
            the money earmarked for their train fares home to the dormitory fund.</p>
          <p>Please see Series 6, Benevolent Association, for additional files related to the
            acquisition of land for residence halls and operation of the dormitories. The Benevolent
            Association, incorporated in 1926, managed the campus residence halls until 1967.</p>
          <p>The series also contains records which document the construction of Alumni House, begun
            in 1974, and its subsequent use as a conference center on campus and gathering point for
            alumni. Like the dormitory effort, the Alumni Association formed an Alumni House
            Building Committee in 1972 and the series contains files on the Committee,
            correspondence, construction plans, photographs, and event materials.</p>
          <p>Please see the related Alumni Memorabilia Collection for Anna Pierce's materials from the
            Class of 1884 and Marialla Conklin Whitbeck's files from the Class of 1899, both of
            which contain additional information about campus buildings and dormitories.</p>

          <p>The Benevolent Association of the New York State College for Teachers was incorporated
            in 1926 and its Board of Directors first met in Albany in August 1927. While the
            organization's constitution stresses that its main purpose is to "heighten and enrich
            the physical, mental, social and moral life of the students," the Benevolent Association
            was closely connected to the Alumni Association and an outgrowth of the original
            Dormitory/Residence Hall Building Committee. The Benevolent Association acquired
            property for dormitories and operated the College (and later University) resident halls
            until 1967 when they were sold to the State of New York. The Alumni Association also
            helped nominate the Benevolent Association Board which carried out the policies and
            recommendations of the Alumni Association. Both groups held their annual meetings at
            approximately same time. </p>
          <p>In addition to management of the residence halls, the Benevolent Association
            administered and bequeathed scholarship funds and supported key University projects. In
            1982 the Benevolent Association merged with the University Foundation and Annual Fund of
            the Alumni Association to become the University at Albany Fund, Inc., the central
            fund-raising arm of the University.</p>

          <p>The Theatre Alumni Association of the New York State College for Teachers formed in
            1932 to bring alumni together through dramatics and debating. Initially, members were
            required to have been part of the advanced dramatics class in college, must have taken
            part in sufficient plays to satisfy the membership committee or have participated in at
            least two intercollegiate debates. However there are no subsequent records of this group
            and in June 1954 alumni of State College proposed an organization of former dramatics
            student to allow alumni greater opportunity for continued participation in the College's
            theatre activities. The Theatre Alumni Association officially requested affiliation with
            the Alumni Association of the State University of New York at Albany in 1963. The
            Theatre Alumni Association dissolved in 1974 with the goal of forming a new organization
            that brought together faculty, alumni and students in the Theatre Department.</p>
          <p>The records in this series contain the 1932 organization's constitution, the 1954
            organization's list of objectives, a revised 1963 constitution and by-laws, executive
            committee minutes and reports, a scrapbook with clippings about College theatre
            performances, correspondence, newsletters and membership lists. The group held an annual
            meeting and party and there are many files detailing events held and awards created to
            honor Agnes Futterer, member of the Class of 1916 and professor of speech and drama at
            the College from 1917-1959. In 1957 the first Agnes E. Futterer Award was given on
            Alumni Day to a graduating student making valuable contributions in dramatics.</p>

            <p>WARC files are very large and difficult to work with. Your request may take time to process, and we may be unable to deliver your request remotely. Please consult an archivist if you are interested in researching with web archives.</p>
