      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Julius Wyler, born August 9, 1891 in Basel, Switzerland, immigrated to the United States in 1941, arriving in New York City on the day of his fiftieth birthday. A month later, he joined the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research where he lectured for the next fifteen years on topics in statistics, economic research, national income, world economy, and United States industrial development.</p>
      <p>In addition to his lecturing at the New School for Social Research, Wyler also participated in the Council of Research of the Institute of World Affairs of the New School from 1944 to 1951. He also worked with the Office of Strategic Services in 1941-1942 on a project dealing with the gross national product of nine belligerent countries, and spent another year 1943-1944 working at the National Bureau of Economic Research on a comprehensive survey of the national incomes of over thirty countries.</p>
      <p>Before immigrating to the United States, Wyler served for twenty-five years in the Federal Statistical Office (Eidgenössische Statistische Amt) in Berne, Switzerland, working first as a statistical clerk and later promoted to Assistant Director of the Office. During his years at the Statistical Office, he reorganized and edited the Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland, headed the division of Vital Statistics, and was commissioned to head a study of the reorganization of the entire governmental statistics of Switzerland. He conducted numerous studies, many of which were published under the name of the Federal Statistical Office. Wyler also served as a guest lecturer to the Economic Division of the Faculty of Law at the University of Berne, giving classes on statistics, population, business cycles and national income. During the three years immediately preceding his emigration to the U.S., Wyler was granted a Rockefeller Research Fellowship for a study of the estimates of the balance of payments in the United States and Canada, also allowing him several months of study in the United States.</p>
      <p>Julius Wyler died in 1959 in Forest Hills, New York, survived by his wife and one daughter, Eva.</p>
