      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Department of French Studies was created in 1973 along with the Department of Hispanic and Italian Studies when the Department of Romance Languages was split. Currently French is taught within the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. The French major was discontinued in 2011 although students still have the option of minoring in the subject or initiating an interdisciplinary major in French.</p>
