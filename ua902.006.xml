      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Joseph L. "Joe" Norton was born on September 6, 1918 in Albany, New York. He received a B.A. in French (1940) and an M.A. in Personnel Psychology (1941), both from St. Lawrence University, and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Syracuse University (1950). He married in 1947 and had two children. In 1971, he divorced and shortly afterwards came out publicly as gay.</p>
      <p>After brief spells in insurance and teaching high school as well as a stint in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1942-1945, Norton began his academic career as Assistant Professor and Counselor at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan from 1949-1951. From 1951 to 1953 he was Associate Professor of Psychology and Director of Counseling and Placement at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Norton spent ten years as Professor of Educational Psychology at Alfred University in Alfred, New York before coming to SUNY Albany (now the University at Albany, SUNY) to be a Professor of Education in 1963. He remained in that position until his retirement in 1983. Norton's early teaching and research interests lay mainly in educational psychology and vocational placement, and later he became interested in LGBT counseling issues and sex education.</p>
      <p>In addition to his academic work, Norton was a prominent figure in the gay rights movement within his community and profession. He helped to found the Capital District Gay &amp; Lesbian Community Council (now known as the Pride Center of the Capital Region); the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York; the National Caucus of Gay and Lesbian Counselors of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists; and the Caucus of Gay Counselors of the American Personnel and Guidance Association. He served as advisor to the Gay Liberation Front in New York State (1971–1972) and was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Gay Task Force (1976–1978). Norton also was involved with the Association of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexuals in Counseling; the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force; the New York State Coalition of Gay Organizations; the National Association of Gay Psychologists; and Interweave, an LGBT organization affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist church. He also frequently gave talks and presentations to professional, school and community groups in the Capital District and beyond.</p>
      <p>Joe Norton died on May 18, 2011, at the age of 92.</p>
