      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This manuscript collection contains retained copies of memoranda (1959-62) 
	  sent to Governor Rockefeller by his counsel, Robert MacCrate, 
	  concerning pending bills in the New York Senate and Assembly. 
	  Bound with the memoranda are copies of the Governor's approval or 
	  veto messages for the bills. The memoranda and approval or veto messages 
	  are arranged by year and source of the bill (Senate or Assembly), 
	  and thereunder by bill number. All bills considered by the legislature 
	  are not included in this collection, but the range of subjects in the bills
	  that were considered by MacCrate was quite large including 
	  business regulations, court reorganization, education law 
	  and zoning regulations. Yearly subject indexes to the Governor's approval 
	  and veto messages for both Assembly and Senate bills appear at the end of 
	  the last volume for each year.</p>

      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p> Robert MacCrate was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on July 18, 1921.  
	  He married Constance Trapp on May 4, 1946, and they had three children: 
	  Christopher Robert, Barbara Constance, and Thomas John. 
	  MacCrate received a B.A. from Haverford College in 1943, 
	  and an LL.B. from Harvard University in 1948.  
	  He was accepted to the New York bar in 1949 and 
	  to the District of Columbia bar in 1965.  
	  He was an associate of the firm Sullivan and Cromwell in New York city 
	  from 1948 to 1955, and later he was a partner (1956-59, 1962-present).  
	  He was law secretary to New York Appelate Division Presiding Justice David W. Peck (1951), 
	  and counsel to New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller (1959-62). 
	  Under Governor Rockefeller, MacCrate, served as associate counsel 
	  (Feb. 2, 1959-June 1, 1959) and then counsel (June 1, 1959-June 30, 1962). 
	  The primary responsibility of counsel to the governor was to translate 
	  the governor's programs into law. He and his staff ensured that bills 
	  were correctly drafted and helped to prevent enactment of bills that 
	  were antithetical to the governor's programs. 
	  Along with the budget director and the secretary to the governor, 
	  the counsel was one of the people on whom Governor Rockefeller relied most 
	  heavily for administration and program development. Macratae later serves 
	  as special counsel to the U.S. Army investigation into the Mylai incident 
	  (1969-70), counsel of the New York State Court on Judiciary (1971), 
	  and President of the American Bar Association (1987-89).  
	  He has contributed articles to professional journals.[1] </p>
