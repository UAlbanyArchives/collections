      <p>Steven King Ainsworth, currently incarcerated in California, was previously sentenced to death and served two decades on Death Row in San Quentin. In 2001 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California granted Ainsworth's habeas corpus petition vacating his capital sentence. Ainsworth is a published writer of fiction and non-fiction, and a self-taught artist whose work has been exhibited in the United States and internationally. His many publications include Words from the Row and essays or short stories in Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words (2001), Writing for Their Lives: Death Row U.S.A. (2007), and Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America (2014).</p>
