      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The Environmental Decisions Commission of the State University of New York at Albany
	  (as the University at Albany, SUNY was then known) was established in 1971 by President
	  Louis T. Benezet. The commission was charged with developing a policy base for decisions
	  on matters relating to the environmental health and aesthetic quality of the university as
	  well as the campusâ€™ impact on the surrounding community. In the nearly ten years of its 
	  existence, the commission dealt with issues such as dredging and stocking the campus pond,
	  traffic control, parking, the use of road salt and pesticides, recycling of paper, composting,
	  and energy conservation.</p>
      <p>The Environmental Decisions Commission was organized and funded on campus in the same era 
	  as the Environmental Studies Program and the Environmental Forum. However, the Commission survived
	  the budget cuts that ended the other programs in 1977. The Commission was dissolved in 1980, and
	  its responsibilities were thereafter performed by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains the administrative files of the Environmental Decisions Commission
	  including correspondence, meeting minutes, agendas, and reports. These files are in chronological
	  order with the earliest years of 1971-1973 most thoroughly documented. The records continue until
	  1980 with correspondence about the dissolution of the commission. Much of this collection is composed
	  of mimeographed copies of meeting minutes and reports. In a few cases the mimeographs have begun
	  to fade, but all remain legible.</p>
      <p>Related Collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives
	  can be found in the subject guide for Conservation and the Environment and the University Archives.
	  Of particular interest are the papers of Jackson Davis (APAP-141) and Louis Ismay (UA-902.064) and
	  the records of the Environmental Studies Program (UA-XXX.001), Office of the President (UA-000),
	  and the University Senate (UA-200).</p>
