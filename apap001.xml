      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>
				The Albany Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) was
				founded in 1932 as a chapter organized to represent professors at the New York State
				College for Teachers in Albany, N.Y., and to promote AAUP's goals of protecting
				academic freedom, promoting faculty governance, and pressing for salaries equal to
				their professional status.  Regional meetings of the AAUP chapters in the capital
				district began in the 1935-36 school year and continued until World War II.
				[AAUP--Albany Chapter, Minutes, October 31, 1945]
			</p>
      <p>
				In 1944 the chapter, which always maintained an interest in faculty governance and ways
				to implement such, argued for the establishment of a Faculty-Administration Council at
				the New York State College for Teachers.  This body became a significant policy
				making body on campus, its membership composed of administrative staff, including the
				President of the College and the Dean, and twelve elected faculty members.  An important
				predecessor to the University Senate, the Faculty-Administration Council held its last
				recorded meeting in 1955.
			</p>
      <p>
				During the 1960s, many changes affected the Albany Chapter.  The former New York State
				College for Teachers became a university in 1962, and by the mid-1960s an entirely new
				and much larger campus had been built to house this institution.  Concurrently, AAUP
				was revitalizing regional cooperation in New York through the formation of the New York
				State Conference of Chapters of AAUP and the Council of SUNY Chapters of AAUP, both of
				which the Albany chapter was affiliated with.  The most significant change, however,
				was the 1967 implementation of the Public Employees Relations Act (commonly, the Taylor
				Law), which authorized collective bargaining for all state employees, including
				university professors.  The Public Employees Relations Board (PERB) decided that all
				professionals employed at the State University of New York would constitute a single
				bargaining unit.  The Albany chapter at this time was opposed to being the
				representative for this unit, because it recognized the university's professors as a
				group of employees with needs and desires substantially different from those of other
				professional staff.
			</p>
      <p>
				The question of who would be the bargaining agent for professionals at the State
				University of New York at Albany became an important one for the Albany chapter of AAUP
				and the campus as a whole.  In November 1968, the entire SUNY-AAUP Council voted to ask
				PERB to add AAUP to the ballot to elect a bargaining agent for all SUNY campuses.  A
				questionnaire that the Albany chapter distributed on campus in 1968 showed widespread
				support for collective bargaining and for AAUP to be the bargaining agent for the
				professionals on campus.  By this time, PERB had not yet decided whether all of the
				State University of New York or its individual campuses would constitute the bargaining
				unit with the state.

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>
				The overreaching goal of AAUP as a whole and the Albany Chapter as one of its
				affiliates was the establishment and protection of academic freedom.  This topic was a
				frequent subject in the minutes and correspondence of the chapter.  Different aspects
				of this freedom were in play at different times during the chapter's history.  In the
				early 1950's freedom of debate was an important topic as was the concept of loyalty
				oaths (which AAUP argued were a means to undermine academic freedom).  During the
				mid-1960s the faculty workload was of great concern to the chapter, and by the late
				1960's, when labor organizations were beginning their organizing campaigns on SUNY
				campuses, collective bargaining for professors became a pressing concern.
			</p>
      <p>
				The records of the Albany Chapter of AAUP contain minutes (1944-59), correspondence and
				memoranda (1950-65), leaflets (1946, 1951-58, 1965-74), Albany chapter newsletters
				(1963-71), and presidents' files (1944-60).  These records document the activities of
				the local chapter of AAUP.  Of special interest is the opportunity these provide to
				show how AAUP reacted to the introduction of unionization to a professional workforce.
				The presidents' files contain correspondence, reports, memoranda, and other material
				held by the presidents of the Albany chapter.  Records from the national association
				include chapter letters (1944-64), which were distributed to all members of AAUP.
