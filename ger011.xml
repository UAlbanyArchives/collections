      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Kurt Bauchwitz was born in Halle (Saale), Germany on July 12, 1890 to Edmund and Ida
                (Sachs) Bauchwitz. Kurt exhibited a talent for writing at an early age and published
                his first serious writing piece at the age of fourteen. During his childhood, he
                also studied piano and gave his first concert at sixteen, however decided against
                pursuing a career in music as too time-consuming. After graduating from gymnasium in
                1908, Bauchwitz attended the universities of Grenoble, Munich, Berlin and Halle,
                where he studied law, completing his studies in 1912. During his university years,
                he continued to write poems and aphorisms and published pieces in <emph render="italic">Der Jugend</emph> and <emph render="italic">Nord und
                Süd</emph>.</p>
      <p>At the conclusion of his studies in 1912, Bauchwitz was appointed Referendar and
                served as a junior judge and barrister until 1921. During this time period,
                Bauchwitz also served in the German army, having volunteered for service in October
                of 1913. He was called to active duty in 1914, served on the Western Front until the
                end of the war, and received both the Iron Cross and Medal of Honor for bravery.
                Also during this time period, he continued to write poetry, composing many of the
                poems later published in his first and only published volume of poetry, <emph render="italic">Der Lebendige</emph> (1920), while serving in the German army.
                Bauchwitz married Else Schwabach on February 22, 1917, who gave birth to their first
                son, Kurt Helmut, on April 22, 1919, and a second son, Till, on May 9, 1922.
                Bauchwitz was widowed in 1931 by the death of his wife Else on March 15.</p>
      <p>From 1921 to 1938 Bauchwitz practiced law in Berlin, receiving his degrees of
                Pol.Sc.D. and LL.D. from the University of Halle in 1924. . He specialized in
                international commercial law, family and social law. In 1926 he received the
                appointment of Notar (notary), by the Minister of Justice. This appointment was
                revoked by Nazi legislation effective November 1935 which deprived all "non-Aryan"
                Notare of their profession. In November 1938, his right to practice law was
                terminated for the same reason. As a result, Bauchwitz was forced to close his
                Berlin law firmoffice. Two years later, his right to practice law is terminated, and
                in November of 1938, Bauchwitz is forced to close his Berlin law office.</p>
      <p>His termination in 1938, marked the beginning of a series of radical changes for
                Bauchwitz. Later that year, on December 16, Bauchwitz married his secretary Hilde
                Michaelis. Just prior to his departure from Hitler's Germany in March 1939,
                Bauchwitz is baptized as a Catholic. On April 3, 1939, Bauchwitz leaves Nazi
                Germany. After several months, Bauchwitz, his new wife and two sons arrive in Japan,
                where they remain for nearly eighteen months before their eventual departure for the
                United States on November 20, 1940. The period, which began with Bauchwitz'
                departure from Germany and ended with his eventual arrival in the U.S. in December
                of 1941, was one of his most fertile creative periods. During this time, he
                collected many of his earlier poems and epigrammatic verse to form the collection he
                called the "Abzieh-Bilderbuch". In addition, he wrote over 200 poems, later entitled
                his "Tokyo poems", which would also be the last significant collection of poetry in
                German he would write.</p>
      <p>Following his arrival in New York City, Kurt Bauchwitz, German writer and lawyer,
                would become Roy C. Bates, on his way to becoming a naturalized American citizen and
                writer. In 1941, Bates' divorced and from 1942-1943 Bates pursued a course of study
                at the Columbia University School of Library Science, receiving a B.S. degree in
                October 1943. Bates' diligent efforts at perfecting his English language skills
                result in securing him an editorial position on the Funk &amp; Wagnalls New
                Standard Encyclopeida staff from 1944 to 1947. Bauchwitz also becomes an American
                citizen on May 6, 1946, legally changing his name from Kurt Bauchwitz to Roy Curt
                Bates at this time, and less than two years later, marries Barbara Bent, on March
                16, 1948.</p>
      <p>Although Bates continued to write during the late 1940s and early 1950s, composing
                poems, epigrams, short prose, and even song texts in English, only one of his
                efforts in English saw publication despite his continued attempts to find
                publication outlets for his writings.</p>
      <p>The 1950s saw the resumption of Bates' legal career with his return to the study of
                law, first at St. John's University (1953-1954) and later at New York University
                (1954-1956), where he received his LL.B. degree in February 1956. On June 19, less
                than one month before his 67th birthday, Roy C. Bates became the oldest person at
                that time to be admitted to the Bar and practice in New York State. Several years
                later in 1962, after relocating to Milton, Massachusetts, Bates was also admitted to
                the Massachusetts State Bar.</p>
      <p>Bates continued to write during the 1950s and 1960s, however, his writing took the
                form of semi-autobiographical observations, which he recorded on a regular, often a
                daily, basis. Three series of these collections of observations, the first series
                entitled "Pebbles" and the later two entitled "Quotation Marks", make up the bulk of
                his writing activity during this time. Bates also became interested in the legal
                aspects of psychedelic drugs during the 1960s, which resulted in his participation
                in the M.I.T.-based Neurobiological and Psychedelic Study Group, as well as
                publication of an article on "Psychedelics and the Law" in 1964.</p>
      <p>Although Roy Curt Bates (Kurt Bauchwitz) was a lawyer by profession both in Germany
                and later in the United States specializing in international law, his enthusiasm for
                writing which began in early childhood, survived the change from a German-speaking
                to an American writer, and is evidenced by the large body of written work he left
                behind. Bates died in Milton, Massachusetts on July 18, 1974 at the age of 84.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Roy C. Bates Papers, 1890-1994, concentrate primarily on the literary career of
                Bates/Bauchwitz (1910-1974), with a secondary emphasis on the legal career of Bates.
                The materials document his early years in Germany (1890-1938), the years of flight
                from Hitler Germany via Japan to the United States (1938-1941), and his U.S. years
                (1941-1974).</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into six series: 1) biographical materials, including
                documents, 1890-1974; 2) correspondence and related materials, 1914-1987; 3)
                manuscripts and typescripts, 1928-1974; 4) publications, 1910-1972; 5) miscellaneous
                materials, arranged by subject; and 6) oversize materials. The earlier materials
                (pre-1941) are in German, with materials after 1941 primarily in English.</p>
      <p>The biographical materials contain many early documents, including school and
                university diplomas, birth and marriage certificates, German military record, and
                documents pertaining to Bauchwitz's dismissal from his legal position by the Hitler
                regime. Also included in this section are a series of curriculum vitae, as well as
                several biographical statements intended as introductions to volumes of poetry, and
                a small number of photographs.</p>
      <p>The correspondence consists of nearly 5,000 letters, primarily 1941-1974, and has
                been divided into five sub-categories, arranged alphabetically within each
                sub-series: 1) personal, which represents the largest section and includes
                correspondences with family members (esp. his two sons) and life-long friends; 2)
                legal correspondences; 3) correspondences re: literary topics and publications; 4)
                correspondence re: psychedelic drugs and schizophrenia; and 5) miscellaneous
                correspondences.</p>
      <p>The manuscripts and typescripts have been divided between poetry (including
                epigrammatic verse and aphorisms) and prose. The poetry section, dating from circa
                1926, is primarily written in German, with the exception of his later epigrammatic
                verse collections "Ego and Echo" and "Monogrips", which are in English. The prose
                sub-series includes short prose pieces (the majority written in English) and his
                loosely autobiographical collections of daily observations, which span nearly three
                decades, 1950-1966, which he entitled "Pebbles" (later "Question Marks").</p>
      <p>The publications section contains copies, either in the original or in photocopy, of
                nearly all of Bauchwitz'/Bates' published writings, including his first and only
                published volume of verse <emph render="italic">Der Lebendige</emph> (1920), as well
                as his many published "Letters to the Editor.".</p>
      <p>The miscellaneous materials section has been sub-divided into the materials of Roy C.
                Bates and those of his wife, Barbara Bent Bates. The Roy C. Bates materials consist
                primarily of clippings and materials files, arranged alphabetically by subjects on
                legal topics, organizations and other subjects of interest to Bates. The Barbara
                Bates materials are divided between her own writings (and publications) and her
                attempts to publish her husband's writings posthumously. Oversize materials consist
                of diplomas (2), as well as two paintings, which were probably given to the Bates as
                gifts.</p>

          <p>This series contains documents, several selections of diary entries,
                        photographs and curriculum vita of Bates. The documents pertaining to Roy C.
                        Bates (Kurt Bauchwitz) date from 1890 to 1974 with later documents
                        pertaining to Barbara Bates (third wife), which date through 1995. Included
                        in the collection are many early documents such as birth certificates, early
                        school documents, marriage certificates from Bates/Bauchwitz' first two
                        marriages in Germany, as well as university and military service documents.
                        Also in the collection are a number of documents which record
                        Bates/Bauchwitz' legal career as well as his subsequent dismissal from his
                        post by the Hitler regime in 1938. His period of flight from Nazi Germany is
                        also well-documented, as well as his early years in the U.S., including his
                        naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 1946. Also included in this section are
                        documents pertaining to his university studies in the U.S. at Columbia, St.
                        John's and New York Universities. Completing the biographical section of
                        this series are a number of curriculum vita, several biographical statements
                        prepared for planned editions of Bates' poetry, as well as a number of
                        photographs.</p>

          <p>The correspondence files contain photographs, offprints and clippings in
                        addition to the correspondence (ca. 5,000 letters), which dates primarily
                        from Bates' U.S. years (1941-1974), although a few earlier letters are
                        present in the collection. Several correspondences were continued after
                        Bates' death in 1974 by his widow, Barbara, until as late as 1987. Letters
                        are in German, English and French and have been divided into five

                            Abeille von Ehrenfels, the most extensive correspondence in the
                            collection, dating from 1939-1974 between Ehrenfels and Bates, and
                            continuing between Barbara Bates and Mireille Abeille (1974-1987),

                            the 1960s led to his participation in the M.I.T.-based Neurobiological

                            poetry and epigrammatic verse, and chronologically within each grouping.
                            Main groupings include: Der Lebendige, "Abzieh-Bilderbuch", "Tokyo
                            poems", "Einsätze/Monogriphs", "Gedichte", "Versepigramme", "Silben:
                            Haiku und tanka", "Ego and Echo", and "Der Zitronenbaum". With the
                            exception of the "Monogriphs" and AEgo and Echo" collections, which are
                            in English, the majority of the poems, epigrams and aphorisms are in

                            prose pieces in German and in English, and the later prose writings
                            written almost entirely in English. These include Bates' loosely
                            autobiographical observations, the first series collectively entitled
                            "Pebbles" and the later series entitled "Question Marks". Also included
                            in this section are the outlines of Bates' "Biotechnics" with notes for
                            a "Biosophic Seminar", accompanied by numerous note slips divided into
                            the various categories of biosophy, as defined by Bates.</p>
