      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Helen Quirini (1920-2010) was a lifelong resident of Schenectady, New York. She was known
        for her dedication to numerous causes, such as organized labor, the YWCA of Schenectady,
        gender and racial equality, social welfare, and local activism. Although Quirini focused
        primarily on the Capital Region, she also worked for statewide and national causes. She
        advocated the repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 and participated in the 1963
        March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. During her 39 year employment at General Electric
        (GE) and her 30 year retirement, Quirini advocated for the better treatment of employees and
        retirees by the management of GE.</p>
      <p>Born March 9, 1920 to Marie Ogonowski and Frank K. Quirini, Helen Quirini was the youngest
        of four children and attended Mont Pleasant High School. On April 1, 1941, at the age of 21,
        Quirini began working for GE's Schenectady plant doing piece work in the factory. The United
        States' entrance into World War II interrupted her initial plan to save money in order to
        attend college. Quirini decided to work at GE throughout the war as a service to her
        country. By 1945 she had established a pattern of union leadership and community activism
        that continued for the rest of her life.</p>
      <p>At General Electric she joined the Athletic Board, advocated for equal treatment for female
        employees and organized drives for the local Red Cross. She joined a union, Local 301, which
        was first affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE) and later,
        beginning in 1954, with the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers
        (IUE). Quirini held many executive leadership positions with Local 301, served on numerous
        labor committees, was a union shop steward and regularly attended union conferences and
        conventions. Quirini was a vocal force for employee rights, both in boardroom meetings with
        GE executives and during strikes, protests and work stoppages. In 1953 Quirini mobilized
        mass protests to advocate for equal pay for women workers at GE. She walked picket lines in
        all types of weather in support of union solidarity. While employed at GE and as a member of
        Local 301, Quirini achieved a number of firsts. In 1953, she became the first woman elected
        chairperson of the special UE-GE Conference Board Meeting, held that year in Chicago.
        Quirini also was the first woman and hourly representative elected chairperson of the GE
        Employees Share Fund in 1975.</p>
      <p>Quirini was accused of Communist Party affiliation during the McCarthy era because of her
        union advocacy. She received a subpoena and testified in a pre-hearing that she was not a
        proponent of Communism, but sought equal rights for all individuals. She testified that she
        had attended a Communist meeting, and even mentioned seeing "company men" from General
        Electric there. The case against her was dropped. Quirini filed a Freedom of Information Act
        request decades later to review the documents held by the FBI from the McCarthy era.
        Redacted copies of the completed request are available in Series 2.</p>
      <p>After her retirement from General Electric in 1980, Quirini became well known for her
        attempts to win greater benefits for GE retirees through advocacy, shareholder proposals and
        her annual speech at the GE shareholders meeting. Always wearing a bright T-shirt with the
        words "GE Brings Good Things to Retirees, Please" Quirini, along with other retirees and
        their supporters, frequently picketed at General Electric in Schenectady and at the annual
        shareholder meetings. She served as president of Local 301 Retirees Council and co-founded
        the GE Retirees Justice Fund. Her highly visible role at shareholder meetings brought her to
        the attention of Jack Welch, the chairman and CEO of General Electric from 1981-2001. Local
        playwright Gail George wrote a one-woman play about Quirini's relationship with Welch
        entitled <emph render="italic">Helen and Jack.</emph></p>
      <p>During her employment for GE, Quirini volunteered for non-union related causes. She joined
        the YWCA of Schenectady in 1943 and eventually became its president. Through her United Way
        work with Local 301, she began working with the Refreshing Springs Child Day Care alongside
        her friend Reverend Georgetta Dix in 1970, where her varied executive duties lasted until
        1987.</p>
      <p>Quirini continued her activism during her retirement by volunteering for the rights and
        benefits of seniors and community causes in Schenectady County. She was a member or director
        of a wide variety of civic and labor organizations, including: the American Association of
        Retired Persons Chapter 490, Better Neighborhoods Inc., Citizens for Preservation and
        Revitalization, Human Services Planning Council's Aging Committee, IUE Local 301 Retirees
        Council, New York State Wide Senior Action Council, Schenectady Council of Senior Citizens,
        Schenectady County Committee on Health Care Issues, Schenectady County Council of Child Day
        Care Centers, and Schenectady County Human Rights Commission.</p>
      <p>Quirini also was the recipient of many awards. She received the United Way Joseph A. Beirne
        Award, the YWCA of Schenectady Jefferson Award and the General Electric Gerald L. Phillippe
        Award. She also received the Patroon award, the highest honor given by the City of
        Schenectady. Series 1 contains many more awards and related material.</p>
      <p>Selections from <archref linktype="simple" href="http://www.albany.edu/history/histmedia/Hq.html" actuate="onrequest" show="new"><emph render="italic">Helen Quirini and General Electric: A Personal Memoir of World
            War II</emph></archref> are made available online through the University at Albany
        Department of History's History and Media Initiatives website and a copy of the full memoir
        is found in Series 1.</p>
      <p>Quirini also appeared in other publications about unions, women and community activists.
        Her work for GE retirees garnered her and the pension cause coverage in major newspapers and
        magazines across the country. In the 1990s, the Schenectady General Electric in the 20th
        Century Project extensively interviewed Quirini and different periods of her life are
        documented in articles and student research papers, many of which are available in the
        collection. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection documents the life, work and activism of Helen Quirini of Schenectady, New
        York. The collection represents Quirini's numerous activities and interests including her
        early work owning a local market with her brother, her 39 year employment for General
        Electric, her activism in unions during her employment and retirement, as well as her
        charitable activities where she pursued civil, housing, pension, women's and senior
        citizen's rights. </p>
      <p>The M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives received this collection
        through multiple donations. Helen Quirini donated material over approximately 10 years and
        her nephew Rudy Quirini donated the final materials following Helen Quirini's death in 2010.
        Many of the papers lacked original order and therefore archivists needed to impose order
        throughout the collection. Archivists created the series structure to represent Quirini's
        personal life, employment, labor union work and activism. She held many executive board
        positions after her retirement and remained an active volunteer and labor rights activist
        until her death. There is occasional overlap between topics and series such as senior
        citizens (Series 6, Subseries 5) and pension rights (found in General Electric Series 5). </p>
      <p>Quirini spent nearly her entire life in Schenectady, New York. This collection offers a
        perspective into industrial work during World War II and the life of a female union activist
        in the mid-20th Century through photographs, diary entries, labor union literature,
        grievance reports Quirini filed and labor union convention materials. The collection
        documents the workings of various local organizations through meeting minutes, budgets,
        correspondence, publications, by-laws, treasurer's reports and other internal documents.
        Quirini also worked for local chapters of larger organizations. Quirini was active in her
        local community and corresponded with State and National legislators about a variety of
        topics, including day care services, labor unions, local government, Schenectady County
        development, senior citizens' issues and more. </p>
      <p>Quirini maintained extensive subject files with clippings, articles, photographs and
        reports. Also available are collections of publications and newsletters from relevant
        organizations, such as UE and IUE publications and the New York State Wide Senior Action
        Council's newsletter. </p>
      <p>The audiovisual portion of this collection includes audio and video cassettes, DVDs, CDs,
        reel-to-reel tapes, 8mm film and 45 RPM record singles.</p>
      <p>Please note that not all dates are inclusive.</p>
      <p>Related collections in the Department of Special Collections and Archives include the
        records of IUE-CWA Local 301 (APAP-023), Ralph Boyd Papers (APAP-165, Helen Quirini's friend
        and fellow advocate for the rights of GE Retirees), Associated Industries of New York State,
        Inc. (APAP-043) , and the New York State Wide Senior Action Council (APAP-111). Issues of
        the newspapers of Local 301 are available in microfilm, paper, and electronic format in the
        records of IUE-CWA Local 301 (APAP-023) including special Local 301 publications from the
        1966 and 1969 strikes.</p>
      <p>Quirini deposited various materials at other repositories including the: Schenectady Public
        Library (material related to Georgetta Dix) and the NYU Tamiment Libraries and Robert F.
        Wagner Labor Archives. Her nephew Rudolph Quirini also donated materials to the
        Grems-Doolittle Library at the Schenectady County Historical Society.</p>

          <p>This series includes material about Helen Quirini's life and achievements. This series
            has correspondence, awards and certificates, newspaper articles by and about Quirini and
            her activism, letters of recommendation, theses, interview transcripts, diaries of her
            time on the shop floor at General Electric, her memoir, photographs, ephemera and more.
            This series covers the entirety of Quirini's life and work starting with the Brother
            Sister Cash Market where she worked with her brother in the late 1930s and early 1940s,
            her 39 years working at General Electric and then her post-retirement activism. The
            original order, titling and folder contents were preserved wherever possible. Quirini
            received a variety of national awards including the Beirne Award from the United Way and
            the Phillipe Award from General Electric. She also received local accolades such as the
            Patroon award in her hometown of Schenectady, New York. Included in the award folders
            are nomination materials, letters of recommendation, resumes, related materials and the
            awards themselves. This series contains extensive correspondence regarding Quirini's
            personal life, employment, activism and fundraising. There also are many VHS cassettes
            of Schenectady City Council meetings which Quirini attended as a citizen. Series 1
            covers her activism, awards and achievements as both the subject and author of newspaper
            articles. Several students also corresponded with Quirini and wrote about her in papers
            and masters theses. Scholarly publications which predominantly feature Quirini are
            located in this series. Please see Series 2 and Series 3 for other scholarly writings
            about unions in general, Local 301 or General Electric.</p>

          <p>This series documents Helen Quirini's extensive union activities through her membership
            in Local 301. When Quirini joined this local it was affiliated with the United
            Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE). During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the
            federal government kept UE leadership and its members under surveillance because of
            suspected Communist ties. In his aggressive investigations of accused Communists,
            Senator Joseph McCarthy, chairman of the Committee on Investigations of the Committee on
            Government Operations, subpoenaed Quirini and she was one of many members of the UE to
            testify in a pre-hearing before Congress in February 1954. She swore under oath that she
            was not and had never been a member of the Communist Party. Citing these supposed
            Communist connections, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) expelled the UE in
            1949 and replaced it with the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine
            Workers (IUE). During subsequent years many UE locals elected to join the IUE, including
            Local 301 in June 1954. This series features materials related to all of the
            aforementioned events, including Quirini's subpoena, anti-McCarthy literature issued by
            unions, Quirini's surveillance files and a significant amount of propaganda from both
            unions issued before Local 301's vote to join the IUE.</p>
          <p>Quirini was very outspoken about issues affecting business and politics. During the
            UE/IUE switch, she was the only executive board member of Local 301 to oppose the move.
            A personal statement in the files explains her reasoning and disappointment with her
            subsequent treatment from fellow members of Local 301. Her many grievances in this
            series illustrate her advocacy for greater equality for women in the workplace and
            better working conditions for all employees. She retained many news clippings and
            materials discussing strikes she participated in at General Electric in the late 1960s
            and 1970.</p>
          <p>Quirini served her union during both the UE and IUE periods in many capacities, the
            extent of which is documented in this series through correspondence, reports, financials
            and other Local 301 business documents, conference proceedings, contracts, election
            campaign materials, newspaper clippings, photographs and notes. She held elected
            positions in Local 301 from the 1940s through the 1970s. Quirini was first elected
            secretary in 1947, and later served as treasurer and a shop steward. Her committee work
            included service on the social action, education and human relations committees. She
            attended union meetings and conferences and played for Local 301 women's basketball and
            championship softball teams when a young woman.</p>
          <p>In addition to her direct union involvement, Quirini engaged in several related
            projects. As an active and then a retired member of Local 301, she was a delegate to the
            Schenectady Area Central Labor Council and attended meetings. In addition to meeting
            minutes, reports and correspondence, there are papers documenting the education program
            about labor for Schenectady public schools that Quirini created as chair of the
            Council's education committee, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. </p>
          <p>As a labor representative, Quirini also served on the Schenectady Private Industry
            Council (PIC), part of the Capital Area PIC and was active from 1981 through 1993. The
            related files in this series record the organization's duties under the Job Training
            Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982. The organization tried to implement JPTA through
            coordination and planning with business (small, large, minority), labor, and other
            concerned groups and ultimately provide employment and training for displaced or
            underprivileged job seekers and research and job-ready employees to private industry.
            PIC files include the internal documents of the Capital Region and Schenectady County
            PIC, such as meeting minutes, proposals, memorandums and correspondence, as well as
            documents relating directly to the JTPA legislation.</p>
          <p>Researchers also will find general labor literature from the AFL-CIO, UE, IUE and other

          <p>This series deals with the specific issue of women's rights and representation in the
            workplace and union. It contains significant materials, including correspondence,
            agendas, resolutions and news clippings, about UE and IUE women's conferences (both
            national and regional), educational programs and committees. Helen Quirini attended and
            spoke at many of these events and her handwritten notes are often included among the
            materials. Subject files discuss such topics as equal pay for equal work, automation,
            pay rates and the Equal Rights Amendment. There are files with records from speaking
            events featuring Quirini, Quirini's notes from the shop floor on the treatment of women
            and her later writings about the discrimination she encountered at General Electric as a
            female employee. In addition, there is UE, IUE, AFL-CIO and U.S. Department of Labor
            literature on women workers collected by Quirini. </p>
          <p>Quirini was active in the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW). She attended its
            founding conference in Chicago in 1974 and many subsequent national conferences and was
            involved in its Capital District chapter during the 1980s. The nonpartisan CLUW brought
            together women from various trade unions to address shared concerns to common problems.
            It remains the only national organization for women workers in the United States.</p>

          <p>This series contains a wide variety of materials pertaining to General Electric,
            especially its operations in Schenectady where Helen Quirini worked from 1941 until
            1980. There are files related to GE's corporate and administrative operations, such as
            annual reports and benefits information, materials illustrating Quirini's participation
            in the GE Athletic Association and her work with the Share Fund, and a scrapbook created
            by Quirini of the history of GE in Schenectady. Of interest to researchers may be files
            addressing work at GE during World War II, materials from the GE Apprentice Alumni
            Association and publications issued by GE.</p>
          <p>A significant number of files discuss GE retirees and their fights to secure better
            pensions, especially cost-of-living allowances. As a president and member of the Local
            301 Retirees Council and a founding member of the GE Retirees Justice Fund, Quirini was
            active and extremely outspoken for the rights of retirees during the last 30 years of
            her life. This series documents her efforts in this fight, including picketing at GE
            offices and annual meetings, organizing rallies, introducing shareholder proposals and
            addressing GE executives at the annual meeting, corresponding with Jack Welch and
            Jeffrey Immelt during their respective tenures as chairman of the board and chief
            executive officer of GE and conducting media outreach. As a result, she was featured in
            many news articles and playwright Gail George created a one woman show in 1999 about
            Quirini's struggles for retiree rights with GE management, entitled Helen and Jack.
            There are several folders about the play Helen and Jack. Correspondence documenting
            Quirini's friendship with George as well as video of George's performances also are in
            the series.</p>
          <p>This series features correspondence, news clippings, photographs, subject files,
            pamphlets, pay stubs, reports, background materials, manuals, speeches, audio/video,
            news releases and media advisories.</p>
          <p>Please see Series 2 and 3 for more information about Quirini's labor union experiences
            while working at GE.</p>

            <p>This subseries documents Schenectady County's Human Rights Committee and its
              day-to-day activities, as well as learning materials developed by the group for the
              community. The subseries contains agendas, annual reports, minutes, news clippings,
              magazines, pamphlets and booklets. It features materials on the Martin Luther King Jr.
              Commemoration, the March 19th Coalition and information on other coalitions that
              combated racism. Included in this subseries are the 1972 Mont Pleasant High School
              hearings, during which Helen Quirini questioned students at her alma mater about
              escalating racial tension. </p>

            <p>Helen Quirini joined the Schenectady YWCA in 1943 and later became one of its
              strongest advocates. She went on to serve on the board of directors and was elected
              president in 1979. This subseries contains materials illustrating the YWCA's
              day-to-day activities and its contributions to the community. The subseries consists
              of agendas, minutes, newsletters, magazines and flyers. It also features pamphlets on
              domestic violence, racism, feminism and equality as well as information on the
              YWCA-run battered women's shelter in Schenectady. </p>

            <p>Despite not having children of her own, Helen Quirini was very involved in
              Schenectady County day care. She originally represented labor on the Child Care
              Coordinating Council during World War II. She chaired the Schenectady County Child
              Care Council and was also a board member of the New York State Child Care Coordinating
              Council. She worked directly with day care centers such as the Christ Church Day Care
              center and the Refreshing Springs Day Care where she was an administrator alongside
              her longtime friend Reverend Georgetta Dix, who founded and ran the center. </p>
            <p>Subseries 3 includes administrative materials like internal correspondence, budget
              material, clippings, frequent correspondence with the Schenectady Department of Social
              Services' Commissioner Richard Staszak, informational packets, proposed legislation
              and meeting minutes from multiple organizations, including the Schenectady Child Care
              Council, Schenectady Day Care Council and the Early Childhood Task Force. Budget and
              financing information is the primary focus of the internal documents including Title
              XX and other State or Federal funding institutions. Information regarding establishing
              or finding a day care center, funding and entitlement, event programs, transcripts of
              spoken testimonies and conference materials are also present in this subseries.</p>

            <p>The materials in this subseries concern housing, energy and development in
              Schenectady County. Some materials were gathered by Helen Quirini in response to
              development plans by the Metroplex Development Authority in Schenectady County,
              Industrial Development Agencies (IDA) and Schenectady Economic Development Corporation
              (SEDC). Metroplex was created in 1998 to coordinate economic development activities.
              Several of Metroplex's proposals met with resistance from the public, including the
              proposal to tear down the Gazette Building on State and Broadway and replace it with a
              new Department of Transportation office building. Quirini, with others from Preserve
              Schenectady's Future, filed a lawsuit to save the Gazette Building. Citizens for
              Preservation and Revitalization (CPR) and the March 19th Coalition were organizations
              formed in opposition to Metroplex and its proposals. In 2002, the Glenville Energy
              Park was proposed and Citizens Advocating Responsible Development (CARD) petitioned
              against it. Quirini gathered other materials as part of activities with consumer
              advocacy groups. She joined Better Neighborhoods Inc. in 1971, was elected to the
              board in 1981 and served as president from 1984-1986. She also served on the Consumer
              Advisory Council of Niagara Mohawk in the late 1980s. </p>

            <p>During her retirement, Helen Quirini was extremely active in many organizations for
              senior citizens on local, statewide and national levels. In addition to work on behalf
              of the GE Retirees, she served for many years as president of Chapter 490 (Schenectady
              County) of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and as president of the
              Schenectady County Council of Senior Organizations. The files contain meeting minutes,
              events materials, financial records, correspondence, newsletters and petitions from
              these two groups.</p>
            <p>Her participation in the Schenectady County Council of Senior Organizations led in
              1987 to her involvement with the StateWide Senior Action Council. Quirini served as an
              at-large board member and later as treasurer of StateWide. She received the Rose
              Kryzak Advocacy Award as a leader on public policy issues, both locally and statewide.
              A grassroots organization composed of individual senior citizens and senior citizen
              clubs from across New York, StateWide is involved in legislative issues and campaigned
              against Medicare cuts and mandatory retirements. The group fought for pharmaceutical
              insurance for the elderly, assistance for seniors with utility payments and greater
              protection of hospital patient rights. The files reflect StateWide’s advocacy
              activities and feature testimony, including Quirini’s, before legislative panels and
              materials from an annual Grassroots Senior Citizens Day which encouraged seniors to
              come to Albany to meet with elected representatives. There also are board meeting
              minutes, correspondence, convention booklets and materials from Quirini’s local
              chapter of the organization.</p>
            <p>Quirini also joined the Public Service Commission’s Albany Area Senior Citizen
              Advisory Council in the mid-1980s. This group advised on customer expectations and
              utility needs from a senior’s perspective. One of key recurring issues was the
              increasing costs of telephone service. In 1992 this Advisory Council joined with other
              special needs consumer groups to form the Public Service Commission’s Capital District
              Utility Consumer Advisory Council. Quirini remained on this newly formed Council until
              at least 1993. Agendas, meeting minutes, notes, correspondence and reports from
              Quirini’s tenure on both Councils are present. </p>
            <p>In addition to her work with area organizations, Quirini also became involved in
              national issues most relevant to seniors. Qurini fought for the repeal of the Medicare
              Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 which she argued had modest benefits and would
              burden elder Medicare recipients with extra costs and taxes. Qurini chaired mass
              informational meetings of area seniors groups to discuss the Medicare Catastrophic
              Coverage Act in 1988 and 1989. These featured state and local legislators, individual
              seniors and leaders of senior citizen groups as speakers. Notes, speeches, photographs
              and flyers from these events and general background materials about the legislation
              are in this series. </p>
            <p>The IUE nominated Quirini to attend the New York State Governor’s Conference on Aging
              in March 1995. She subsequently served as part of the New York delegation to the White
              House Conference on Aging held in May 1995. This series features materials from both
              conferences, including official reports and resolutions as well as Quirini’s
              correspondence and notes. </p>
            <p>Other items of interest in this series are pamphlets written by Quirini on a variety
              of issues affecting seniors and materials about the Social Security Notch provision
              which affected benefits paid to individuals, like Quirini, born between 1917 and
              1921.</p>
            <p>Please see Series 5 for materials related to Quirini's work with the GE Retirees on
              behalf of pension reform.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains documents from different social service and relief
              organizations in Schenectady County. These include the Human Services Planning
              Council, the Schenectady Friends of Human Services, the Youth Employment Services
              Committee, and Quest. It documents their day-to-day activities as well as their
              contributions to the community. The subseries contains agendas, annual reports,
              by-laws, correspondence, financials, meeting minutes, news clippings, pamphlets, and
              reports. It includes information on social service, job referral in the Schenectady
              area, as well as each organization's efforts to help members of the Schenectady
              community. It also contains information on Judy Atchinson, a prominent member of Quest
              who wrote consistently in her blog, which is included in the subseries. Helen Quirini
              was active with these organizations during her retirement and kept up-to-date with
              these committees until 2009. </p>

            <p>Helen Quirini was active with the United Way for several decades, both through Local
              301 and during her retirement. This subseries documents United Way's day-to-day
              activities and its contributions to Schenectady and nearby areas. It contains agendas,
              meeting minutes, allocations, financials, fund distribution materials, newsletters,
              magazines, flyers, and pamphlets. It also features information on the Joseph A. Beirne
              Community Services Award, which Quirini received in 1978. The subseries includes
              Quirini's handwritten notes and her personal binders. There is also information on
              United Way's executive committee and the group Concerned Citizens for a Fair and
              Inclusive United Way. </p>
            <p>Please see Series 1 for more information on the Beirne Award and Quirini's other
              awards and commendations. </p>

            <p>This subseries is composed of materials produced and collected by Helen Quirini
              during her work with a number of organizations on the issues of health care and health
              care reform. It features correspondence, news clippings, publications, meeting agendas
              and minutes, reports and subject files. One organization documented in this subseries
              is the Health Systems Agency of Northeastern New York (HSA/NENY). Quirini served on
              its board of directors for many years beginning in the late 1970s. Established by
              Congress during the Gerald Ford administration, HSA/NENY was one of eight agencies in
              New York created to control rising health care costs. The materials for HSA/NENY were
              frequently shipped in bundles in preparation for upcoming meetings and much of the
              material in this subseries has been maintained in that order. Other organizations
              documented in the subseries include the Schenectady County Committee on Health Care
              Issues, an advocacy organization for quality regional health care, and the Health Care
              Action Line, a help line started to assist people with questions about health care
              reach trained volunteers. The Berger Commission's recommendations to reform and
              restructure New York's health care became legal mandates on January 1, 2007. In
              Schenectady, St. Clare's Hospital, Bellevue Woman's Hospital, and Ellis Hospital were
              restructured or merged as a result. Quirini was very active in seeking to maintain
              high quality care in the community. </p>

              health care. </p>
