      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Business and Professional Women's Clubs of New York (BPWNYS) was founded in April 1919 by a group of 100 women at the Hotel Pennsylvania 
	  in New York City led by Abbie (Gail) Laughlin. Laughlin also served as the organization's first national president. The organization's first 
	  president was Adaline Zachert of Rochester, New York. The federation was to be "not just another woman's organization," but was to become, within 
	  a quarter of a century, one of the strongest sources of unified women power in the nation.[1] Originally known as the New York State Federation 
	  of Business and Professional Women's Club, the purpose of the clubs was indicated in their constitution as: </p>
      <p>to unite organizations of Business and Professional Women in order to come to a better knowledge and understanding of their conditions and 
	  needs in different sections of the state; to secure more equitable treatment and just recognition for women in business and the professions; 
	  [and] to gather and distribute information relative to vocational opportunities and to bring about a greater solidarity of feeling among women 
	  throughout the State.[2] </p>
      <p>The BPWNYS has been interested in achieving its goals through both state legislation and Federal enactment. The Clubs have not only made 
	  themselves felt in their respective communities but offered programs of study and action directly related to the woman in business. Since passing 
	  the Todd bill permitting women's jury service in 1937, BPWNYS has been a leader in passing much of the nation's landmark civil and women's rights 
	  legislation including: the Equal Pay Act of 1963; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Family and Medical 
	  Leave Act of 1993; the Women's Business Ownership Act; and more recently, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.[3] Through these, the Clubs are 
	  working on building better workplaces by focusing on equal and fair pay issues, flexible hours and parental leave, and policies for improved child 
	  and elder care.</p>
      <p>Education has always held an important place in the Club's work. "A high school education for every girl" was one of the first goals set up to 
	  train young women for business and to help them make places for themselves in the business world.[4] Through regular meetings, BPWNYS has recognized 
	  the political, professional and personal achievements of young professional women and offered programs to provide education and guidance. Projects 
	  include the New York City Commission on the Status of Women that brings women's issues to the attention of important governmental figures, the 
	  Working Women's Clothes Closet that provides proper business attire for those who would otherwise not be able to afford business clothes, the Young 
	  Careerist Program that provides young business women and men with valuable chances to network, the Youth Leadership Program that offers workshops to 
	  high school aged girls that are designed to make them aware of available career opportunities, and Girl Scout and Business and Professional Women, a 
	  program that provides Girl Scouts with the necessary knowledge to succeed in their future careers.[5]</p>

          <p>This series consists of the constitution and by-laws and annual reports of the Clubs (1960-1998). The constitution and by-laws provided the organizational structure of the Clubs. 
It includes printed copies of the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs (1924, 1930, 1933, 1938), certificates 
of incorporation and by-laws (1944, 1946, 1950, 1962, 1973), and proposed revisions to state by-laws (1967, 1974). </p>
          <p>The annual reports of the Clubs are similar to the histories of BPWNYS found in series 4 in that they are a chronological account of annual activities of the Clubs. The annual 
reports also include detailed information of various activities under the agenda or theme of each year, a photograph of the Club's president, the news of the state board meeting and 
annual convention, officers and committee member lists, and awards and membership reports. This series also includes documents pertaining to the projects that the BPWNYS was involved with. 
It includes brochures, correspondence and other documents pertaining to the BPWNYS' booth at the 1965 World's Fair, a script for a dramatic reading entitled "An Unfinished Tapestry," written 
by Dorothy Titchener, that tells the story of the founding of the BPWNYS, brochures and reports from "Project Buttonhole," a program designed to promote affirmative action and the handbook 
for the membership "Tee-Off," for recruiting new members to the BPWNYS. </p>

          <p>Series 3 consists of the records of the annual legislative conference (with gaps), the BPWNYS annual conventions, 
and the national conferences held by the National Federation. State legislation committee members, and the hostess club's 
president, vice president, and chairs who attend these conferences each year create the annual legislative conference records. 
With a long and proud history of action and commitment, this conference continues to work together with the original idea of 
"women helping women," by supporting and initiating legislation to make a more equitable position for women in the job market. 
It encourages women to become involved in legislation so that they can gain power in political life in ways other than just 
supporting candidates, but by getting into the power structures of party politics.</p>
          <p>The records of the BPWNYS annual conventions include minutes (with gaps). The voting body at the annual state convention consists of 
the elected officers, district directors, state standing committee chairs and the duly elected delegates of the affiliated clubs or their 
alternates, and past state presidents. Through a convention, the Clubs encourage the greatest possible number of members to attend, and 
offer an opportunity to those attending to personally meet the national representative.</p>
          <p>The records of the national conventions that have been held by the National Federation (BPW/USA) include the minutes, financial records, 
and proceedings produced during the course of these conventions. The National Federation is composed of local business and professional 
women"s clubs from across the country.</p>

          <p>The Publications series consists of a Manual of Instructions for the BPWNYS (1958), 
				Supplemental Manuals to the National Handbook of the BPW (1940, 1948), booklets on the history of 
				the BPWNYS (1919-1994, with gaps), and magazines (1922-2001). The Supplemental Manual (to be used 
				with the National Handbook) represented the combined efforts of a committee, providing an invaluable aid to 
				local club presidents and committee chairs. The histories of the BPWNYS provide a chronological overview of the 
				Clubs' activities since its inception. In this regard, the booklets of histories of BPWNYS are similar to the 
				annual reports in series 1 due to the brief information they contain.</p>
          <p>This series also includes a group of organizational magazines that include New York State Federation of Business 
				and Professional Women's Clubs-Notes (1922), Newsletter (1933-1936), one National Business Women's Week Magazine from 
				1939, The New York State Business and Professional Woman (1948-1952), and NIKE (1955-2001). Particularly before the 
				publication of NIKE in 1951, many issues of publications are missing but there are enough here to give us an interesting 
				insight into BPWNYS. This series also contains photocopies of pages from the May 1990 issue of NIKE, which is not found 
				in hard copy in this collection.</p>
          <p>The group's official publications began with the New York State Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs-Notes 
				edited by Jane J. Martin and published in July 1921. The next publication was a Newsletter edited by Miss Irene McGuire of 
				Saratoga Springs, and the first issue of The New York State Business and Professional Woman edited by Miss Lottie Edwards and 
				Mrs. Anne Birrell Scott of Albany and New York City was printed in magazine form with advertising in 1937. Since 1951, NIKE, 
				the newly named state magazine, has been published. It was issued eight times a year from 1951-1954, bi-monthly from 1955-1963, 
				and then became a quarterly magazine.</p>
