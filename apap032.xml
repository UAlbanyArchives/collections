      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Harold Rubin was born in the Bronx and began his civil service career with New York State in 1950 as a statistician with the Public Service Commission. He joined the Department of Commerce in 1953 as an economist and the division of the Budget in 1956 as a research analyst, where he held a variety of positions until he retired in 1989 as a chief budget examiner. Rubin has a B.S.S. from the City College of New York and a M.P.A. and a Ph.D. from Syracuse University. A prominent Albany neighborhood activist since the 1960s, he is also known for his participation in a 1978 lawsuit which stopped Governor Carey's attempt to disclose the outside income of top level bureaucrats.</p>
      <p>As a community leader, Rubin has chaired the Council of Albany Neighborhood Associations (CANA) from its inception in 1976 to May 1996. While playing a significant role advocating neighborhood concerns throughout the City of Albany, Rubin has also been active in the Center Square Neighborhood Association, his residence since 1964. He has also been an active member of the Coalition for Effective Code Enforcement, the Neighborhood Resource Center, and Friends of Albany Public Library. Among the causes that Rubin has fought for are tenants rights and the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and areas in Albany [Information on Harold Rubin's career from Kyle Hughes, "Albany's Gadfly Ends State Career", <emph render="italic">Albany Times Union</emph>, 3 May 1989; Karen Roach, "Neighborhood Group Turns 20", <emph render="italic">The Daily Gazette</emph>, 28 January 1996; and from Harold Rubin].</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Harold Rubin Papers consist for the most part of files Rubin kept as a neighborhood activist interested in historic preservation and neighborhood renewal in Albany, New York between 1964 and 2002. To a lesser degree they document Rubin's legal struggles with the administration of New York State Governor Hugh Carey over Carey's 1978 attempt to force New York State civil servants to disclose outside sources of income, and his interest in Governor Mario M. Cuomo's attempt to withhold salary increases for civil servants.</p>
      <p>Rubin chaired the Council of Albany Neighborhood Associations (CANA) from May 1976 to May 1996. CANA is the coordinating body for Albany neighborhood associations. Rubin has also been involved with the Neighborhood Resources Center, the Center Square Association (his neighborhood), and the Capitol Hill Architectural Review Commission. His files on these organizations contained correspondence, minutes, news clippings on the organizations and issues they were interested in, organizational newsletters, and reports. His files also contain extensive correspondence with other Albany neighborhood organizations such as Hudson/Park Neighborhood Association and Pine Hills Neighborhood Association. The files included correspondence with Albany organizations interested in urban renewal and historic preservation including the Capitol Hill Improvement Corporation, the Capitol Housing Rehabilitation Corporation, the Historic Albany Foundation, Historic Resources Commission (1988), Historic Sites Commission, Albany Industrial Development Agency, Mayor Corning Memorial Committee (1984), and St. Joseph Housing Corporation (1983).</p>
      <p>Rubin's files also contain correspondence with New York City and New York State organizations interested in historic preservation including the Brownstone Revival Committee, New York State Council on Architecture, and Preservation League of New York State; and national correspondence with and information on the Alliance for Neighborhood Government and Neighborhood Preservation. There is also a small general Clippings/Miscellaneous File on Albany issues of concern to Rubin.</p>
      <p>The files are organized into four series: Albany Community Subject Files, 1964-1989; a State Employment Subject File, 1975-1977; a Neighborhood Associations File which contains sub-series on the following organizations: Council of Albany Neighborhood Associations (CANA), 1975-2002, Neighborhood Resource Center, 1975-1990, Center Square Association, 1972-1979, Capitol Hill Architectural Review Commission, 1971-1988, Coalition for Effective Code Enforcement, 1974-1977; and a general Clippings/Miscellaneous File, 1972-1980. An inventory of the 2004 accession is also included in the relevant series, but that material has not as of yet been fully arranged and described.</p>

          <p>The files relate primarily to Harold Rubin's opposition to Governor Hugh Carey's attempt (Executive Order #10, #10-1) to impose financial disclosure requirements on civil servants which would have curtained their participation in outside activities. They include a statement by Barbara Zaron, president of the Organization of New York State Management/Confidential Employees, at the Civil Service Merit System Hearing of 1984 and two letters on the issue. Also included are briefs and a memorandum on James T. Evans, M.D. vs. Hugh L. Carey, Governor, concerning the public financial disclosure of civil servants private income records and the briefs on Susan Rapp vs Governor Carey on disclosure of public servants and the the Executive Order overturned by the New York Supreme Court of Appeals in James T. Evans vs. Governor Carey. There are briefs and exhibits on the salary increase withholding lawsuit of 1983, Charles Shattenkirk and Eugene Tashman vs Michael Finnerty, Budget Director of New York State, and Governor Mario Cuomo.</p>
