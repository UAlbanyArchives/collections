      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>Campus Action was formed in April of 1992 as a multi-cultural, multi-issue organization with a mission to promote activism and support activist organizations on university campuses in New York's Capital Region. It maintained eight chapters representing individual campuses as well as a central office at the Social Justice Center in Albany. Campus Action was led by David Easter, the founder and coordinator, and a board of directors. The campus chapters in the Capital Region, including the University at Albany, possessed considerable autonomy.</p>
      <p>The primary goal of Campus Action was to increase progressive activism on college campuses and build cooperation between campus and community activist groups. To this end, it produced a number of publications, including guidebooks for organizing, specific issue guides on racism and sexism, and directories of activist groups. Its most regular publication was the<emph render="italic">Campus Action News</emph> newsletter, an update of activities and events, published three times a year. Campus Action offered internships to students interested in working for an activist organization and published an <emph render="italic">Alternative Internship Directory</emph> that directed students to other organizations. In addition, Campus Action sponsored and organized a number of events including a biannual organizing conference for a variety of causes, workshops, protests, and demonstrations.</p>
      <p>In April of 2006, David Easter announced that he was stepping down as coordinator of Campus Action and closing the central office. This meant that publication of Campus Action News would cease and the website would no longer be maintained, but the individual campus chapters would continue to function.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of Campus Action contain materials collected and generated by the organization including both paper documents and electronic records. These materials include minutes, correspondence, publications, grant applications, webpages, fliers, leaflets and other handouts. The collection holds material from the Campus Action central office and does not contain material specific to the individual chapters of Campus Action.</p>
      <p>Campus Action created a number of publications for campus distribution. These include the newsletter<emph render="italic">Campus Action News</emph>, two study guides, and directories of local activist organizations and internships. These are all well represented in the collection, along with materials from the biannual conferences held to help organize activism, primarily as paper documents with some additional later material in electronic form. There is a lack of records from 2000 when David Easter was on hiatus and, for example, there were no issues of <emph render="italic">Campus Action News</emph> produced.</p>
      <p>The central office collected a great deal of material on issues of interest to Campus Action, including acquaintance rape, racism, war protest, feminism, and civil liberties. The paper materials deal heavily with the issue of date rape and sexual harassment on campus, while the more extensive electronic files include more recent material on a wider variety of topics. All electronic records were reformatted to Printable Document Format (PDF) files and can be viewed with Adobe Acrobat Reader.</p>
      <p>Campus Action's opposition to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is particularly well documented in the electronic records, with related defenses of detainees in the civil rights and racism sections. The case of Ali Yaghi is also documented in the electronic records. Yaghi, an Albany resident and owner of a pizza shop, was arrested just days after 9/11. He was detained on the basis of a tip by a passerby, who claimed to have heard Yaghi making anti-American statements. Yaghi was detained for months and though eventually cleared of all allegations related to terrorism, he was deported to his native Jordan because of his immigration status.</p>

          <p>This series consists of records generated by Campus Action directly pertaining to its administrative functions, either on paper or stored on the hard drive of the main computer. Included are meeting agendas, minutes, memoranda, and organizational records such as by-laws and procedures. In addition, the series includes materials related to several fundraising methods explored by Campus Action, from holding dances to applying for grants. This series contains some correspondence, but this largely consists of mailings to members and related organizations rather than internal correspondence.</p>
          <p>The electronic files include several spreadsheets that have been converted to PDF format. This allows them to be viewed, but the nature of the format has split some of the longer columns in ways that render them difficult to read. In addition, four databases cannot be converted without sacrificing their functionality. Contact a staff member for further information.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The materials in this series relate to issues of interest to Campus Action. These files contain collected publications, news clippings, articles, fliers, webpages, correspondence, and other materials related to the individual topics of interest. Particularly well documented in the paper records of Campus Action is the issue of date rape on university campuses. Campus Action's opposition to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is particularly well documented in the electronic records, with related defenses of detainees in the civil rights and racism sections. Represented here are also materials created by other campus groups that worked with Campus Action including the Black and Latino Network; Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network; and the NETWORK student organization. The case of Ali Yaghi is also documented in the electronic records. Yaghi, an Albany resident and owner of a pizza shop, was arrested just days after 9/11. He was detained on the basis of a tip by a passerby, who claimed to have heard Yaghi making anti-American statements. Yaghi was detained for months and though eventually cleared of all allegations related to terrorism, he was deported to his native Jordan because of his immigration status.</p>
