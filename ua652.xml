      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p> In 1950, the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York accepted a proposal and 
	a $10,000 grant from the Bureau of Intercultural Education for the academic year 1950-1951 and 
	established a Center for Community Studies (CCS). The CCS had its headquarters at the New York 
	State College for Teachers in Albany, New York, although its staff worked with all thirty-three 
	affiliated institutions in the state university system. CCS was set up as a pilot organization 
	with Dr. William E. Vickery, Professor of Intercultural Education, as its director. CCS’s mission 
	was to identify through research factors that aid in constructing and maintaining strong democratic 
	communities and to promote the factors through education. On the basis of modern research in the field
	of community studies, the staff of CCS chose two main areas in which to experiment. The first of these 
	was rooted in the notion that democratic communities thrive when individuals feel that their input counts 
	and when they believe that they have the right and responsibility to share in community life and to help
	make important decisions that affect them, their neighbors and their whole community. The second principal
	for CCS’s research was guided by the idea that communities become stronger when individuals balance their
	personal needs and desires with those of the community at large. Given the above principles, the staff 
	of CCS set out to find ways to promote participation in community affairs, especially the decision-making 
	process and actions that democratic citizenship imply. It also sought to aid individuals in developing the
	ability to live and work productively while crossing the lines of race, religion, ethnicity, and membership
	in socio-economic groups so as to promote the common welfare of the whole community. </p>
      <p> One of the most interesting fields for carrying out its mission was teacher education, as it was assumed that all
	schools reach all of the children of all of the people. It was recognized that how good schools were as training 
	grounds for good community living depended a great deal on their teachers. Consequently, CCS’s working hypothesis 
	was that the field of community studies was an effective means of training such teachers. As an organization, it
	emphasized its role of alerting teachers to their responsibilities in order to promote better human understanding 
	and constructive thinking in inter-group relations. Teachers were to help their students acquire the ideals, skills
	and patterns of living necessary for living and working together in a complex modern society. Thus, teachers were
	expected to become active participants in community affairs to show in their daily lives the respect for other 
	people that characterizes the free, humane and enlightened citizen, and to make their classrooms laboratories 
	where students would learn good citizenship by living it each day. Moreover, the staff of CCS believed strongly 
	that experiences in community studies could not come from books alone. It was thought that undergraduates and
	teachers in service needed real first-hand experiences in community living under competent guidance and direction. 
	It was also thought that without such guidance and direction, community experience could well discourage further 
	community participation rather than stimulate increased activity in community affairs. In order to fulfill these
	purposes, the staff of CCS developed several projects in community study and human relations. Their work was 
	carried out according to the interests, needs, and facilities of the participating colleges and communities. 
	The programs of the Center for Community Studies included working with school people, members and affiliates 
	of clubs and other organizations, government workers and officials, lay community leaders, and other community 
	workers in solving problems that required the activation and mobilization of social forces, community interest, 
	and citizen participation. The staff of CCS worked to develop a broader awareness and understanding in communities 
	of individual and community needs. These aims were attained through: classes, workshops and seminars in community 
	organizations during which participants would relate theory to specific problems in their communities; guidance 
	counseling and leadership of specific efforts in a single community or neighborhood to define problems and propose 
	solutions, and act upon them, including work of general and special nature relating to the effective functioning 
	of groups, committees, clubs, associations, etc.; internships in community study and development during which 
	students and others were placed as aids, interns, or in some other position in citizens’ councils or councils
	of community service so as to work, cooperate and observe; and research to inquire into the processes by which 
	individuals cooperate to solve community problems and broaden their perceptions of community needs. </p>
      <p> A key concept of CCS’s approach was the principle of action research developed by Kurt Lewin and his associates 
	as they endeavored to find ways to work effectively toward rational social management and social engineering. 
	Operating on the principles of action research, the Center for Community Studies consisted of three divisions.
	First, the State University Conference on Community Studies was made up of representatives of each of the 
	eleven state teachers colleges of the State University of New York. This conference helped to formulate CCS 
	policy, stimulated action-research programs on local college campuses, and distributed information about CCS 
	and its activities to other members of their respective faculties. The second division was a five-person executive 
	committee drawn from this Conference whose duties were to screen projects submitted to CCS for support through 
	grants in-aid and to allocate funds to local programs. The Executive Committee also defined issues and problems 
	to present to the Conference for policy decisions. The third was the staff of CCS whose function was to coordinate 
	the program, provide consultant services, administer the research fund, and help the local college communities interpret
	the program to their colleges. The staff also engaged in research at the colleges and helped the local communities prepare
	their reports for publication and distribution. </p>
      <p> According to the undergraduate and graduate bulletins for the State University of New York at Albany, the Center 
	for Community Studies ceased to exist as a separate entity from the School of Education between the fall of 1964 
	and the spring of 1966. Its programs and research seem to have been absorbed and restructured as an integral part of the School of Education. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p> This collection documents the organization, evolution, scope, thinking, activities
	  and programs of the Center for Community Studies over a period of about 25 years. The 
	  earliest items contained in this collection date from 1825 and were part of the Census 
	  Classification Project for Albany, New York, but continuous records for the CCS itself 
	  start at its inception in 1950 and continue to the apparent date of its disbanding. 
	  There are also some records, mostly memos and letters, that postdate the apparent 
	  discontinuation of CCS that run up to 1976. Major collectors of records appear to 
	  be professors William E. Vickery and Donald Van Cleve.</p>
      <p> Topics which are extensively documented in this collection include action research projects, 
	  extensive course materials, the Three Wishes Project, the development of educational television, 
	  the New York State Citizens’ Council, the Poliomyelitis Project of 1956, in-school testing 
	  materials, student and faculty questionnaires, materials on different areas in which CCS was 
	  of service to the wider community, student papers, the Study of Opinions on Medicine and Child 
	  Health of 1956, the University-Community Cooperation Project and materials on workshops given 
	  by CCS. Also contained in this collection are photocopies of street maps of Albany, New York 
	  from the 1800s and early 1900s.</p>
      <p>Several collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives 
	  provide further information on education and policy issues that were of concern to the faculty, 
	  staff and students of the Center for Community Studies. For complete listings of related
	  collections, consult the subject guides for University at Albany, SUNY Administrative Records 
	  and Education. Of particular note are the records of the Capital Area School Development 
	  Association (APAP-065) and the School of Education (UA-650).</p>
