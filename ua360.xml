      <p>The Office of Financial Management and Budget is a unit within the Division of Finance and Administration that is responsible for management, planning, and analysis of the budget of the University at Albany. The University website describes the purpose of the Office as âto provide support to campus management for all levels of the organization in development, implementation, analysis, and monitoring of the campus operating budget.â It was previously called the Budget Office, and was overseen by the Vice President for Finance and Business. The department is key in developing budget requests to the State University of New York Administration for the coming year.</p>
