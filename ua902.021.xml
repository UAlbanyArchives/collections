      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Leonard Gregory Kastle, American composer, pianist, film writer and director, was born in
        New York City on February 11, 1929. Following his high school education in Mount Vernon, NY,
        Kastle began his musical training at the Julliard School of Music in New York City, 1938-40.
        From 1940-42, he attended the Mannes Music School, where he studied piano with Frank
        Sheridan and composition with George Szell. From 1942-52, Kastle held a piano scholarship
        with Paul Wittgenstein. Kastle studied composition at the Curtis Institute of Music in
        Philadelphia from 1944-50, earning a B.A. in 1950. While at the Curtis Institute, he held
        scholarships in composition with Rosario Scalero, Gian-Carlo Menotti, and Samuel Barber, and
        a scholarship in piano with Isabelle Vengerova. In addition, Kastle attended Columbia
        University from 1947-50. He was a student of conducting with Carl Bamberger in NYC from
        1950-52.</p>
      <p>Kastle's early professional career was spent on Broadway where he was music directory for
        revivals of Menotti's <emph render="italic">The Medium</emph> (1950) and <emph render="italic">The Telephone</emph> (1950) and for Weill's <emph render="italic">Lady in
          the Dark</emph> (1951). He was assistant musical director and conductor for NBC
        television's <emph render="italic">Opera Theater</emph> from 1955-1959, directing one of his
        own operas, <emph render="italic">The Swing</emph> (one act, televised by NBC on June 11,
        1954), as well as works of other composers. Other operas both written and directed by Kastle
        include <emph render="italic">Deseret</emph> (an opera in three acts based on the life of
        the Mormon prophet Brigham Young, televised by NBC on January 11, 1961 and revived in 1978);
          <emph render="italic">The Pariahs</emph>, (opera in three acts about whaling commissioned
        by the Deerfield Foundation; completed in 1966; with excerpts performed in Albany, NY in
        1985); <emph render="italic">The Passion of Mother Ann: A Sacred Festival Play</emph> (opera
        trilogy about the Shakers, excerpts performed: The Calling of Mother Ann in Albany, NY in
        1985, and The Journey of Mother Ann in Potsdam, NY in 1987); and his one-act children's
        opera, <emph render="italic">Professor Lookalike and the Children</emph> (performed in
        Albany, NY in 1988).</p>
      <p>Kastle has a number of musical and orchestral compositions to his credit. Among his
        orchestral compositions are <emph render="italic">From a Whitman Reader</emph> (for voice
        and orchestra), 1954; <emph render="italic">Poontoosuc</emph> (for baritone and orchestra,
        performed at Tanglewood on July 4, 1976), 1974-75; and Piano Concerto (performed by the
        composer as a soloist in Albany, NY in 1981). Kastle's vocal works include <emph render="italic">Three Walt Whitman Songs</emph> (for chorus), 1956; <emph render="italic">Acquainted with the Night</emph> (five songs based on poems by Robert Frost), 1957; <emph render="italic">Three Songs from Moby Dick</emph> (for chorus, winner of the Baxter Prize
        for choral composition), 1963; and <emph render="italic">Mass</emph> (for chorus, organ, and
        piano, televised by PBS on December 25,1977; revised version performed in Albany, NY on May
        30, 1978). Kastle has also composed chamber pieces including <emph render="italic">Piano
          Sonata</emph>, 1950; <emph render="italic">Violin Sonata</emph>, 1955 (revised version
        performed in Albany, NY on March 17, 1986); and <emph render="italic">Piano Suite</emph>,

        film, <emph render="italic">The Honeymoon Killers</emph>, which was released by Cinerama in
        1970. In 1970, the film was chosen by the Museum of Modern Art for inclusion in its film
        archives, and in 1971 it received the Black Humor Award in Paris. <emph render="italic">The
          Honeymoon Killers</emph> was re-released nationally in 1992, when it was also shown at the
        San Francisco Film Festival, the Festivale Internationale Cinema Giovani in Italy, and the
        Film Forum in New York City. In 1998, the film was featured at the Midnight Sun Film
        Festival in Sodankylä, Finland.</p>

        University at Albany, SUNY where he taught composition. After retiring from the University,
        Kastle continued to teach classes as an adjunct faculty member. He died in May 2011 at the
        age of 82. </p>

          <p>Series 3 contains musical scores for many of Kastle's works. The series is broken down
            into subseries according to the six major instrumental compositions found in this
            collection. Each subseries usually contains a manuscript score, while some contain a
            published score. Subseries 3, <emph render="italic">Concerto No. 1</emph>, is the only
            subseries to contain Musicians' parts and tissues of parts.</p>

            Kastle. Like Series 3, Series 4 is also broken down into subseries according to major
            works. Most of the subseries contain Masters of Parts, Blues of Parts, or Tissues of
            Parts as well as Orchestral Scores or Vocal Scores. A large amount of the material found
            in this series is undated.</p>
