      <abstract label="Abstract:">The Vincent J. Schaefer Papers represent the professional
        accomplishments and personal interests of the scientist who discovered cloud seeding.
        Schaefer spent more than 20 years with General Electric in Schenectady, New York, working
        his way up from apprentice, to research assistant, to research associate. In those years he
        was mentored by Irving Langmuir, Nobel Prize winner in chemistry. The work Schaefer did at
        General Electric laid the foundation for further success as he became director of research
        for the Munitalp Foundation, began a highly successful summer science program for high
        school students, acted as an independent consultant, and founded the Atmospheric Sciences
        Research Center at the State University of New York at Albany. This collection contains
        research data, notes, correspondence, publications, and photographs that showcase Schaefer's
        long, industrious scientific career as well as highlighting his many hobbies in local
        history and environmentalism.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Vincent J. Schaefer was born July 4, 1906, the oldest son of Peter Aloysius and Rose Agnes
        (Holtslag) Schaefer. Schaefer had two brothers, Paul and Carl, and two sisters, Gertrude and
        Margaret. The Schaefers lived in Schenectady, New York but enjoyed spending summers in the
        Adirondack Mountains. Schaefer had a lifelong association with the Adirondacks, as well as
        more general interests in hiking, natural history, and archeology. In his youth he was the
        founder of a local tribe of the Lone Scouts and with some of his friends wrote and printed a
        tribe paper called "Archeological Research." Schaefer credited this publication with his
        introduction to many prominent individuals in the Schenectady area, including Dr. Willis R.
        Whitney of the General Electric (G.E.) Research Laboratory. </p>
      <p>In 1922 Schaefer found himself in the difficult position of having to leave school to
        supplement the family income. On the advice of his maternal uncles, Schaefer joined a
        four-year apprentice machinist course at G. E. During the second year of his apprenticeship,
        Schaefer was granted a one-month leave to accompany Dr. Arthur C. Parker, New York State
        Archeologist, on an expedition to central New York. As Schaefer was concluding the
        apprentice course in 1926 he was assigned to work at the machine shop of the G. E. Research
        Laboratory, where he worked for a year as a journeyman toolmaker.</p>
      <p>Somewhat discouraged by his work in the machine shop, Schaefer sought to satisfy a desire
        to work outdoors and to travel by joining, initially through a correspondence course, the
        Davey Institute of Tree Surgery in Kent, Ohio, in 1927. After a brief period working in
        Michigan, Schaefer asked to be transferred back to the Schenectady area and for a while
        worked as an independent landscape gardener. Upon the advice of Robert Palmer,
        superintendent of the G.E. Research Laboratory, in 1929 Schaefer declined an opportunity to
        enter into a partnership for a plant nursery and instead rejoined the machine shop at the
        Research Laboratory, this time as a model maker.</p>
      <p>During the late 1920s and early 1930s Schaefer built up his personal library on natural
        history, science, and his other areas of interest and read a great deal. He also organized
        groups with those who shared his many interests--the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club in 1929, the
        Van Epps-Hartley Chapter of the New York Archaeological Association in 1931, and the
        Schenectady Wintersport Club (which established snow trains to ski slopes in the
        Adirondacks) in 1932. In 1933 Schaefer began work on creating the Long Path of New York (a
        hiking trail beginning near New York City and ending at Whiteface Mountain in the
        Adirondacks). During this period Schaefer also created adult education programs on natural
        history topics which gave him opportunities to speak in the community. Through these many
        activities Schaefer continued to expand his acquaintances, including John Apperson, an
        engineer at General Electric and a devout conservationist of the Adirondacks. Apperson
        introduced Schaefer to Irving Langmuir, a scientist at the G.E. Research Laboratory who was
        awarded a Nobel Prize in 1932 for his work in surface chemistry. Among other things,
        Langmuir shared Schaefer's love of skiing and the outdoors.</p>
      <p>At the Research Laboratory machine shop, Schaefer built equipment for Langmuir and his
        research associate, Katharine Blodgett. In 1932 Langmuir asked Schaefer to become his
        research assistant, which Schaefer accepted. In 1933 he began his research work with
        Langmuir, Blodgett, Whitney, and others at the Research Lab and throughout the G.E.
        organization. With his new colleagues as well as by himself, Schaefer published many reports
        on the areas he studied, which included surface chemistry techniques, electron microscope
        techniques, polarization, the affinity of ice for various surfaces, protein and other
        monolayers, studies of protein films, television tube brightness, and submicroscopic
        particulates. After his promotion to research associate in 1938, Schaefer continued to work
        closely with Langmuir on the many projects Langmuir obtained through his involvement on
        national advisory committees, particularly related to military matters in the years
        immediately before and during the Second World War. This work included research on gas mask
        filtration of smokes, submarine detection with binaural sound, and the formation of
        artificial fogs using smoke generators-- a project which reached fruition at Vrooman's Nose
        in the Schoharie Valley with a demonstration for military observers.</p>
      <p>During Schaefer’s years as Langmuir's assistant, Langmuir encouraged him to carry on his
        own research projects. In 1940 Schaefer became known in his own right for the development of
        a method to make replicas of individual snowflakes using a thin plastic coating called
        Formvar. This discovery brought him national publicity in popular magazines and an abundance
        of correspondence from individuals, including many students, seeking to replicate his
        procedure.</p>
      <p>In 1943 the focus of Schaefer's and Langmuir's research shifted to precipitation static,
        aircraft icing, ice nuclei, and cloud physics. Many of their experiments were carried out at
        Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire, where conditions were ideal for ice studies.
        In the summer of 1946, Schaefer developed a laboratory method to seed supercooled clouds
        with dry ice, and in November 1946 he conducted a successful field test seeding a natural
        cloud by airplane. The resulting publicity again brought him an abundance of correspondence,
        this time from people and businesses making requests for snow as well as scientists around
        the world also working on weather modification. Schaefer's discovery also led to debates
        over the appropriateness of tampering with nature through cloud seeding. In addition, the
        successful field test enabled Langmuir to obtain federal funding to support additional
        research in cloud seeding and weather modification by the G.E. Research Laboratory. Schaefer
        was coordinator of the laboratory portion of the U.S. military-sponsored Project Cirrus
        while the Air Force, Army Signal Corps, and Navy supplied the aircraft and pilots to carry
        out field tests and to collect the data used at the Research Laboratory. Field tests were
        conducted in the Schenectady area as well as in Puerto Rico and New Mexico.</p>
      <p>When the military pilots working on Project Cirrus were assigned to duties in connection
        with the Korean War, G.E. recommended that Project Cirrus be discontinued after
        comprehensive reports were prepared of the project and the discoveries made. The final
        Project Cirrus report was issued in March 1953. While Project Cirrus was winding down,
        Schaefer was approached by Vernon Crudge on behalf of the trustees of a foundation called
        Munitalp to work on their newly-developed meteorological research program. For a time,
        Schaefer worked for both the Research Laboratory and Munitalp, but in 1954 he left the
        Research Laboratory to become the director of research for Munitalp. There Schaefer worked
        with the U.S. Forest Service in the northern Rocky Mountains on Project Skyfire, a program
        to determine the uses of cloud seeding to affect the patterns of lightning in thunderstorms
        (and the resulting forest fires started by lightning stikes). Project Skyfire had its roots
        in an association between the Forest Service and Schaefer begun in the early days of Project
        Cirrus. Schaefer also worked on developing a mobile atmospheric research laboratory and
        time-lapse films of clouds. Schaefer left Munitalp in 1958, turning down an offer to move
        with the organization to Kenya, but he remained an advisor to Munitalp for several years
        thereafter.</p>
      <p>After leaving Munitalp, Schaefer's career turned toward scientific education. His own
        educational background left him with a firm belief in the power of independent learning and
        the importance of hands-on, practical experience. He worked with the American Meteorological
        Society and National Science Foundation on an educational film program and to develop what
        eventually became the Natural Sciences Institute (NSI) summer programs. The Atmospheric
        Sciences Program, as it was first known, gave high school students the opportunity to work
        with scientists while also conducting their own field research and experimentation. From
        1959 to 1961 Schaefer was director of these summer sessions at the Loomis School in
        Connecticut. From 1962 to 1968 he continued the program under the auspices of the
        Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) at the State University of New York at Albany,
        where it became the NSI. During this period Schaefer also continued his consulting work for
        many companies, government agencies, and universities. These consulting activities spanned
        most of Schaefer's career and extended beyond his retirement from the ASRC in 1976.</p>
      <p>While conducting the Atmospheric Sciences Program, Schaefer’s work attracted the attention
        of Dean Oscar Lanford and President Evan Collins of the New York State Teachers College.
        They extended an invitation for Schaefer to come teach, which ultimately led to his founding
        of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center in 1961. Schaefer himself became director in
        1966, a position he held for ten years before giving control to Volker Mohnen. Schaefer
        brought highly qualified atmospheric science researchers to the ASRC, many of whom he had
        met through his work at G.E. and Munitalp. Bernard Vonnegut, Raymond Falconer and Duncan
        Blanchard were all veterans of Project Cirrus who joined Schaefer at the University at
        Albany. In addition to the NSI summer programs, Schaefer led annual research expeditions to
        Yellowstone National Park for scientists to conduct field work in the vicinity of Old
        Faithful. In the 1970s Schaefer's other research interests focused on solar energy,
        aerosols, gases, air quality, and pollution particles in the atmosphere. His work in some of
        these areas culminated in a three-part report on “Air Quality on the Global Scale” in 1978.
        In addition, during the 1970s, Schaefer was an instructor in the American Association for
        the Advancement of Science Chautauqua short courses for science teachers. </p>
      <p>During his retirement, Schaefer worked with photographer John Day on <emph render="italic">A Field Guide to the Atmosphere</emph> (1981), a publication in the Peterson <emph render="italic">Field Guide</emph> series. In addition to continuing his consulting work,
        Schaefer was in a position to devote much more of his time to some of his life-long
        interests such as environmental issues and natural and local history. This included the
        writing of numerous articles and the delivering of many presentations concerning the natural
        environment of upstate New York and the human impact on it. He also devoted much of his time
        to the fight for the preservation of many wilderness areas and parks, such as the Mohonk
        Preserve, Vrooman's Nose, and the Great Flats Aquifer. Schaefer's long-term interest in
        Dutch barns made it possible for him to assume the editorship of <emph render="italic">Dutch
          Barn Miscellany</emph> for a time and to build a scale model of a Dutch barn. He also did
        a lot of research on the original settler families of the Schenectady and Mohawk Valley
        areas. During his retirement, Schaefer reflected on his extraordinary life, preparing
        timelines, an unpublished autobiography, and indices to some of his research notebooks and
        film collections. Schaefer also attended to the disposition of his papers and library. He
        worked on a project he entitled "Ancient Windows of the Earth," which involved the slicing
        of rocks thinly so as to create a translucent look. When he mounted such pieces on
        lampshades or other objects, it created a stained-glass window effect from the natural rock
        layers, highlighting the rock's geologic history. As part of this project, Schaefer designed
        and built a window in memory of his parents for the Saint James Church in North Creek in the
        Adirondacks.</p>
      <p>Schaefer married Lois Perret on July 27, 1935. Until their deaths they lived on
        Schermerhorn Road in Schenectady, in a house Schaefer built with his brothers, which they
        called Woestyne South. Woestyne North was the name the Schaefers gave to their camp in the
        Adirondacks. The Schaefers had three children, Susan, Katherine, and James. Vincent Schaefer
        passed away July 25, 1993 at the age of 87.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Vincent J. Schaefer Papers span Schaefer’s young adult years all the way through his
        retirement after leaving the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the University of
        Albany. His professional papers also include General Electric, the Munitalp Foundation, the
        Loomis School, and independent consulting. Schaefer was particularly well known for his role
        as the scientist who discovered cloud seeding, a development that stemmed from work he did
        with precipitation and ice nuclei studies during World War II. Schaefer was also known for
        his studies of surface chemistry, solar energy, and aerosols, and was a driving force in the
        environmental movements of the 1960s through the 1980s. The collection includes
        documentation of all of these topics, not only by Schaefer but by colleagues with whom he
        worked closely.</p>
      <p>Additionally, this collection contains files documenting Schaefer's myriad personal
        interests, many of which focus on outdoor activities and demonstrate his love of nature.
        Researchers will find that there is much crossover between Schaefer's professional pursuits
        and the activities he enjoyed in his spare time.</p>
      <p>While there are many records in the collection such as research notes, letters, notebooks,
        and maps, Schaefer also donated many photographs and films of his work, particularly in the
        area of cloud seeding. While the bulk of the collection comprises his professional life,
        there are also many files demonstrating Schaefer’s interests in local history, archaeology,
        and geography.</p>

      <p>The overall arrangement of the Vincent Schaefer Papers is chronological in an attempt to
        show the order of his professional accomplishments. This arrangement, however, is not a
        perfect reflection of exact order because many of Schaefer's professional ventures crossed
        over with other projects. For example, he conducted independent consulting work while also
        involved with Munitalp and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, and his work with the
        Atmospheric Sciences Center for high school students began as an independent project at
        Connecticut's Loomis School before migrating with Schaefer to the New York State Teachers
        College (later the University at Albany).</p>
      <p>Most of the files in the series and subseries of the Vincent Schaefer Papers are arranged
        in alphabetical order. Exceptions are the subseries that contain reports and publications,
        which are arranged chronologically. Documents published in the same time frame are in order
        alphabetically by title.</p>
    </arrangement>

          <p>The research laboratory at General Electric was the launching pad for some of Vincent
            Schaefer’s most pivotal scientific work. This series contains research notes,
            photographs, reports (published and unpublished, internal and external), and
            correspondence relating to all of his more famous experiments as well as a range of
            lesser-known work accomplished during his years at the G.E. Research Laboratory in
            Schenectady. The materials cover topics such as smoke/artificial fog generation, surface
            chemistry, studies of ice and snow particles, and early cloud seeding. The series is
            divided according to areas of specific interest to Schaefer as well as correspondence
            and publications. </p>
          <p>Researchers looking for information on Project Cirrus will want to refer to Series #2,
            which is devoted entirely to notes, reports, and photos on that endeavor. However, any
            material not clearly and specifically identified by Schaefer as being Project
            Cirrus-related was not housed in that series; therefore it is likely that some
            correspondence and reports in Series #1 are in fact based in Project Cirrus. Researchers
            are encouraged to utilize both Series #1 and #2 if their interest lies with that
            project. Also notable is the fact that Schaefer was assigned to spend 50% of his work
            time on Project Cirrus, so although he was involved with that project for about five
            years, he did spend half of his time working on other tasks at G.E.’s research
            laboratory.</p>

            <p>The formation and behavior of snow and ice crystals were a lifelong interest of
              Schaefer’s, and in his time at General Electric he was able to focus on the subject
              during the World War II years as ice related to the safety of U.S. Air Force planes.
              Schaefer and Irving Langmuir’s interest in that topic grew as a result of their World
              War II-era contract work with the military, and the experiments they conducted after
              the war’s end led directly to their Project Cirrus contract in 1947—an undertaking so
              extensive that their work in that area merited its own series in this collection. Much
              of their foundational work in snow and ice composition and behavior was grounded in
              observations and experiments conducted on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. Schaefer
              discovered during this time that ice crystals and snowflakes could be captured and
              observed using Formvar plastic. Using this method, he documented very specific data
              about ice and snow before creating some of the first replicas of specific snowflake
              shapes. The work of Schaefer and his colleagues regarding ice research includes
              handwritten notes, drawings, charts, photographs, reports, and correspondence specific
              to ice, snow, and Mount Washington.</p>

            <p>The inspiration for Schaefer’s work with cloud seeding began during his experiments
              with Irving Langmuir during World War II. At that time they were under contract with
              the military for other weather-related reasons, but their research led them to wonder
              about the possibilities of controlling weather beyond military needs. Schaefer
              accomplished some of his most important foundational work with cloud seeding in 1946,
              before General Electric joined in another contract with the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and
              Army Signal Corps. These records document some of Schaefer’s initial work with cloud
              seeding, before the official birth of Project Cirrus. Researchers will also find about
              a dozen files on Project Blowdown, a cloud seeding operation conducted in Honduras to

            <p>This subseries is comprised of various research data retained by Schaefer that were
              not filed specifically with cloud seeding or ice and snow research. These are the
              notes, graphs, drawings, and photographs of experiments that supported later
              discoveries in his larger projects. Notes and photos in this subseries include
              subjects such as surface tension, monomolecular layers, smoke generation, fog, uses of
              calgon, and electron microscopy. Also of note are his observations on precipitation
              and precipitation static, which he worked on with Irving Langmuir during World War II.
              While the bulk of the notes are Schaefer’s own, there are also papers that belonged to
              Langmuir and various other scientists who shared observations with Schaefer. </p>

            <p>Comprising the years 1934 to 1954, Vincent Schaefer’s research notebooks are bound
              volumes containing handwritten observations, formulas, and drawings from his
              scientific endeavors. They comprise their own subseries partly due to the fragile
              nature of the bindings, covers, and paper itself, but also because the nature of the
              bound books prevents their being divided among the categories of snow and ice
              research, cloud seeding, general research, etc. Researchers are encouraged to consult
              these notebooks for information on Schaefer’s World War II projects, cloud seeding,
              surface chemistry, and more. Please note that Schaefer kept two sets of notebooks from
              1940 to 1943—in addition to the larger hardback notebooks, he also kept a set of small
              softcover books that dealt with very specific topics such as smoke filters and
              artificial fog. He also used some of the smaller-size notebooks for scientific
              observations from his own home. </p>

            <p>Schaefer’s correspondence files are arranged alphabetically by subject. They include
              letters sent and received by Schaefer as well as some to and from Irving Langmuir.
              Schaefer also retained letters that were to and from others at General Electric but
              carbon copied to him. While most of Schaefer’s letters came to the archives grouped in
              large, general batches, some were retained separate from the larger groups. The
              archivist kept that arrangement, which is why certain letters are foldered
              individually or in very small groups while the majority of this subseries is simply
              categorized as “general”.</p>
            <p>Due to time constraints, correspondence that might relate to Project Cirrus was not
              culled from this series to be placed in Series #2, so researchers might wish to peruse
              this subseries for Cirrus letters, especially those two and from various branches of
              the military.</p>

            <p>The Schaefer subject files are a collection of brochures, notes, and other ephemera
              that have enduring value but do not belong in other categories such as cloud seeding
              or snow and ice research. These files include research notes from sources other than
              General Electric; scientists and entrepreneurs frequently exchanged results of their
              work with one another, but to avoid confusion, the work of Schaefer and other G.E.
              scientists can be found in the next subseries while informal research notes and
              observations by others are located here.</p>

            <p>These are reports and articles written by Vincent Schaefer that did not directly
              cover work done through Project Cirrus. Many are from his early days at General
              Electric when he was still a research assistant, covering topics such as surface
              chemistry. Any articles co-written by Schaefer and his colleagues are included in this
              subseries. Some articles and reports do discuss early cloud seeding issues but do not
              appear to be directly related to Project Cirrus. When in doubt, the archivist looked
              for credits or acknowledgements to the U.S. military to help determine how a certain
              article or report should be categorized. Please note that many of the articles are
              reprints, which are reflected in the folder dates. Some folders also include
              manuscripts of the published articles or reports, which is indicated in the folder
              title.</p>

            <p>Vincent Schaefer welcomed his colleagues’ professional input and used their published
              works for reference as he refined his own studies. The articles and reports in this
              subseries are a sampling of findings by scientists like Irving Langmuir, Katharine
              Blodgett, Bernard Vonnegut, and more. This subseries also includes magazine and
              brochure types of publications such as G.E.’s <emph render="italic"> Adventures
                Ahead</emph>, booklets about Association Island, and occasional G.E. newsletters.
              Please note that many of the articles are reprints, which are reflected in the folder
              dates.</p>

            <p>As with the work of his own General Electric co-workers, Schaefer collected articles
              and reports by colleagues outside of his own institution as well. These are an
              assortment of publications relating directly to Schaefer’s own work in areas like
              surface chemistry, ice/snow studies and cloud seeding as well as peripheral interests
              in the science world that happened to catch his attention. Please note that many of
              the articles are reprints, which are reflected in the folder dates.</p>

          <p>In 1952, General Electric published its own “History of Project Cirrus”, compiled by
            Barrington Havens of G.E.’s public relations department. In his introduction, he writes
            that “[Project Cirrus] was very complex, with a number of subdivisions associated with
            the main activity. Some of these subdivisions ran consecutively, some operated in
            parallel, and others intertwined or branched off in variously divergent directions.”
            This preface is relevant to Schaefer’s own collection of materials because the
            “intertwined” nature of Cirrus itself, as well as its roots in Schaefer and Langmuir’s
            previous work, sometimes made it difficult for the archivist to separate Project Cirrus
            documents from materials that related to cloud seeding efforts but were not strictly
            part of the work done under the government contract that defined Project Cirrus. </p>
          <p>The archivist made every attempt to be strict with materials placed into the Project
            Cirrus series, using dates, acknowledgements to the military, and the Army Signal Corp’s
            own stamp to help identify documents as Project Cirrus when needed. Researchers may find
            it helpful to consult the cloud seeding materials in Series #1 for items documenting the
            events that led to the project’s founding.</p>
          <p>Project Cirrus bloomed from multiple experiments that converged late in 1946. Vincent
            Schaefer and Irving Langmuir did extensive work for the United States military during
            World War II. Among their projects was the issue of precipitation static interfering
            with U.S. Airforce pilots' ability to fly and land safely. (See Series #1, General
            Electric) Their efforts to deal with the problem took them to the peak of New
            Hampshire's Mount Washington, where Schaefer and Langmuir observed behaviors of snow and
            ice crystals that were relevant to their current work but also gave them ideas for
            future research regarding supercooled water droplets.</p>
          <p>When their contracts with the U.S. military ran out shortly after World War II,
            Schaefer and Langmuir continued studying behaviors of snow and ice particles in earnest.
            Schaefer discovered that he could use a type of special plastic called Formvar to
            capture and preserve snowflakes, some of which can be found in Series #1. These
            experiments led Schaefer to investigate further the behavior of particles in cloud
            formations. On a hot July day in 1946, while working with a cold chamber, Schaefer
            accidentally discovered that the use of dry ice in a supercooled cloud would form
            instant ice crystals. Drs. Irving Langmuir and Bernard Vonnegut added their expertise to
            the process, working with silver iodide as well as dry ice. In no time they worked out
            the potential effects of their discovery on weather modification, and the seeds of
            Project Cirrus were firmly planted.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, on November 13, 1946, Schaefer led a successful cloud seeding expedition
            over Mount Greylock in Massachusetts. His efforts convinced the U.S. military to sign a
            contract with General Electric yet again early in 1947. This time, it was a mutual
            agreement between G.E., the Army Signal Corps of Engineers, the Air Force, and the
            Office of Naval Research. The government hoped that fruitful cloud seeding
            experimentation would open doors for agricultural success and even improved safety for
            the people of the United States. The project sponsored well over 150 flights as well as
            ground operations, with 1948-1950 being the major years for flights conducted. Besides
            basic cloud seeding work, they also experimented with hurricane seeding and wildfire
            fighting in the fall of 1947. The project wrapped up in September 1952 when the Airforce
            pilots began to be called away to Korea, and the G.E. team decided they had gone as far
            as they could with their work.</p>
          <p>This series is divided into three parts: flight data and research, subject files, and
            reports and publications. Each one highlights various aspects of G.E.'s efforts to work
            with the military as they explored cloud seeding options in the late 1940s and early
            1950s.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains materials on specific flights, though the availability of
              data ranges from a single page for some flights to multiple pages with photos for
              other flights. Each one is labeled by flight number, where it took place, what
              operation was performed, and on what date. There are also files on research efforts
              that took place on the ground and in the lab, including charts, diagrams, weather
              observations, and research notebooks. Photographs include particular flights, most of
              which feature aerial cloud views, but there are also general photos that were not
              labeled by Schaefer or his colleagues.</p>
            <p>Researchers will also find documents on two extra Project Cirrus missions, one
              dealing with Hurricane King and the other with Operation Red. Both pursuits took place
              in the fall of 1947. The former related to cloud seeding a hurricane in order to
              expend its energy before it made landfall while Operation Red focused on cloud seeding
              over wildfires in New England. The Hurricane King effort is not to be confused with
              the Hurricane King of 1950; the Project Cirrus crew named the 1947 hurricane on their
              own but did not have a title from official weather bureaus.</p>
            <p>Please note that Schaefer's preliminary materials on cloud seeding, as well as data
              and photos from his 1946 cloud seeding flights, are located in Series #1 because they
              took place before the official creation of Project Cirrus in 1947.</p>

            <p>The subject files feature documents and photographs directly related to Project
              Cirrus, but not to specific flights. Photos include equipment, precipitation, general
              cloud photos, and Schaefer appearing at functions during the Cirrus years. Researchers
              will also find some data on cloud seeding endeavors elsewhere, such as California and
              Sydney, Australia. Correspondence files do exist within this subseries, but
              researchers might also want to consult the correspondence files in Series #1 for the
              years 1947 to 1952 as it is likely that Schaefer kept Cirrus letters with his other
              General Electric correspondence. Other documents include news clippings, bulletins
              from meteorological conferences, and weather radar reports from MIT.</p>
            <p>One highlight of the subject files is the material on Project Blowdown. Unlike
              Hurricane King and Operation Red, which were direct offshoots of Project Cirrus,
              Project Blowdown was a side project of Irving Langmuir’s in which he was advisor to
              Joe Silverthorne, a commercial seeder acting on behalf of the United Fruit Company.
              But their methods were those being used at the same time in the Project Cirrus
              operations. Project Blowdown dealt with intense storms that would destroy stands of
              fruit trees in Honduras. </p>

            <p>These are the articles and reports dealing specifically with Project Cirrus-related
              matters. Some are direct reports to the government regarding progress made while
              others were published in research journals for purposes of letting the outside world
              know what the Cirrus team was accomplishing. The subseries includes some drafts as
              well as the finished products. Researchers might find General Electric’s “Project
              Cirrus: The Story of Cloud Seeding” (Nov. 1952) and Barrington Havens’ “History of
              Project Cirrus” (1952) to be particularly useful summaries.</p>
            <p>As noted in Series #1, Subseries #7, it was not always immediately clear to the
              archivist if a specific publication should be categorized as Project Cirrus or not. In
              those cases, the archivist looked for dates, credits or acknowledgements to the U.S.
              military, or footnotes regarding military contract numbers, to decide where the
              article or report should be filed. Schaefer spent 50% of his work hours on Project
              Cirrus so the fact that a document falls in the Cirrus date range does not
              automatically mean that it was a product of that pursuit.</p>
            <p>Special note: Occasional Report #23 is dated before #22, and the same situation is
              true for Occasional Reports #8 and #9. The archivist has left them in numeric order
              despite the reversed dates.</p>

          <p>Vincent Schaefer's first contact with the Munitalp Foundation came in the early 1950s
            around the time that Project Cirrus was winding down. The day-to-day routine in the
            research lab at General Electric was changing from the way it was in the days of Willis
            Whitney, so in 1951 Schaefer began scaling back his hours at G.E. to collaborate with
            Munitalp's board of trustees. By 1954, Schaefer was ready to make a complete break from
            G.E. to become Munitalp's director of research.</p>
          <p>Munitalp's main focus was meteorological research, specifically cloud physics. Three
            advisors helped formulate the group's goals in the early fifties: Svere Petterssen,
            Horace Byers, and Vincent Schaefer, all of whom came from respected scientific
            backgrounds. As director of research, Schaefer brought some unexplored ideas from
            Project Cirrus to the table, ideas that were given time and attention under the
            resources provided by Munitalp. In collaboration with Director Vernon Crudge, Schaefer
            oversaw research efforts that expanded throughout the United States and beyond. Munitalp
            not only sponsored its own original experiments, but also guided grant-funded projects
            by other organizations having an interest in meteorological work. Woods Hole
            Oceanographic Institute, the University of Hokkaido (Japan), the University of
            Stockholm, and Mount Washington Observatory are just a few of the many institutions that
            collaborated with Munitalp</p>
          <p>Two of the best-known research projects to come from Munitalp are Project Skyfire,
            which dealt with lightning-induced forest fires in the American Northwest, and the first
            use of time-lapse films to track cloud formations. The former attempted to use cloud
            seeding technology to reduce risks of forest fires while the latter provided a whole new
            understanding of everything from jet stream cloud behavior to development of low-lying
            fog-- information used by the American Meteorological Society as well as flight crews of
            the world's major airlines.</p>
          <p>The Munitalp Foundation moved its headquarters to Africa in the late 1950s, and while
            Schaefer traveled there to oversee the transfer, he decided not to remain as director of
            research. Though he officially left the Foundation in 1958, he maintained an advisory
            role for several years thereafter.</p>

            <p>General research essentially covers all documents not dealing with Project Skyfire.
              Since Munitalp’s purpose was to aid other organizations with their meteorological
              experiments, it had many different projects under its wing. Schaefer’s papers in this
              area deal mainly with jet stream and cloud studies and weather modification. One
              specific example of a new weather modification experiment was Project Shower, which
              took Schaefer to Hawaii to work with the Pineapple Institute. Some of the files are
              reminiscent of his work at General Electric since his fascination with particle
              studies continued well beyond his days in the Knolls Research Laboratory. There are
              documents and photographs dealing with clouds, precipitation, and atmospheric
              particles, including some from Mount Washington since Schaefer continued to foster a
              working relationship with the lab there. Time lapse films of clouds and cloud
              formations were also a ground-breaking aspect of Schaefer’s work with Munitalp.</p>
            <p>There are also some files on the mobile lab that Schaefer engineered, an idea that
              followed him after Munitalp when he went to other institutions. Researchers will find
              somewhat less extensive field notes in this subseries than in General Electric, which
              may be a reflection of Schaefer’s increased administrative role with Munitalp.</p>

            <p>Just as Schaefer’s best-known work at General Electric was Project Cirrus, one of his
              most important jobs with Munitalp was Project Skyfire. Schaefer became familiar with
              the problem of lightning-induced forest fires while he was still working at G.E., but
              it wasn’t until he transferred to Munitalp that he could give the issue direct
              attention. Working alongside Harry Gisborne, chief of fire research in Missoula,
              Montana, Schaefer researched the use of cloud seeding techniques in changing patterns
              of lightning storms in the northwestern United States. This subseries contains the
              data, charts, maps, and photographs from this project.</p>

            <p>Since Schaefer was Munitalp’s director of research, and Munitalp participated in
              meteorological projects internationally as well as domestically, Schaefer was
              constantly in contact with associates all over the globe. The substantial amount of
              correspondence that he kept from his Munitalp years shows the greatly increased
              administrative role he held in comparison to his General Electric days.</p>
            <p>The letters include letters directed to him alone, letters that colleagues sent to
              one another but also carbon copied to Schaefer, and carbon copies of correspondence
              that Schaefer sent out. Most of these files came to the archives bundled together
              without labels or other identification, while some were singled out by specific people
              or topics. The archivist kept that arrangement, so researchers will find most of the
              letters filed under the name “general” and identified by year. Others are titled by a
              particular person’s name or subject as well as the year. All of the correspondence is
              arranged chronologically.</p>

            <p>The subject files feature a variety of materials that supplement Schaefer’s Munitalp
              research documents, such as ephemera from some of his many travels, conference
              brochures, and weather research activities of groups not affiliated with Munitalp.
              This subseries also includes administrative files such as personnel information, grant
              writing endeavors, and budgeting, which are reflections of Schaefer’s role as director
              of research. There are also photographs of Schaefer and colleagues, non-Skyfire
              research projects, travels in and out of the United States, and more generic subjects
              such as research equipment.</p>

            <p>This subseries is devoted entirely to articles and reports from Schaefer’s Munitalp
              years. Materials cover a range of topics including Project Skyfire, jet stream
              studies, cloud seeding, particle studies, and research on the relationship between
              environmental factors and the weather. Since this subseries is comparatively smaller
              than the reports and publications for General Electric, works by Schaefer and others
              are mixed together. The files are arranged chronologically, then alphabetically by
              article/report title if necessary. Folder titles note the author of each work. For
              Schaefer’s writings, the archivist noted if there is a manuscript included with the
              published copy.</p>

          <p>Vincent Schaefer began his work as a meteorological consultant when he was still with
            General Electric, then continued during his Munitalp years, but his consulting services
            increased in the late 1950s as he became officially involved with the American
            Meteorological Society (A.M.S.) and New York State Teachers College. It was through the
            A.M.S. that Schaefer became a certified meteorological consultant. A highly diverse
            selection of institutions and individuals sought Schaefer’s advice; his name and work
            began to be widely known during his General Electric days and continued to be recognized
            (and respected) when he was director of research for Munitalp.</p>
          <p>This series is divided into two subseries because the archivist found the materials
            divided between pure correspondence and other materials (such as reports or minutes)
            that had correspondence intermixed. Schaefer’s secretary, Alice Klopfer, handled
            administrative matters for him during his busiest consulting years and the archivist
            believes that the materials in the correspondence subseries were arranged in their
            current manner by Ms. Klopfer. In the interests of preserving that original state, the
            archivist did not add letters to those files during the processing of the remaining
            consulting materials. Therefore, researchers should note that correspondence can be
            found in both subseries.</p>

            <p>The correspondence in this subseries is a mix of letters received by Schaefer as well
              as carbon copies of letters sent by him or his secretary, Alice Klopfer. The archivist
              believes that the filing system used in this subseries was created by Ms. Klopfer and
              has been preserved accordingly. Most folders are titled by the name of the person or
              company for whom Schaefer was consulting, but there are also files titled simply by
              letter of the alphabet—these contain correspondence from sources that were not
              numerous enough to warrant their own folders, and are identified within each folder by
              subject.</p>

          <p>Around the time of Schaefer’s break with Munitalp, the American Meteorological Society
            (AMS, of which Schaefer was a member) approached him to inquire about the possibility of
            setting up a summer science program for promising high school students. They decided on
            the existing Loomis School in Windsor, Connecticut as the location for their summer
            program, which began in 1959 with the support of the National Science Foundation.
            Schaefer and his colleagues wanted to give academically strong students with a
            particular interest in science the opportunity to attend extra lectures and, more
            importantly, experiment with hands-on projects of their choosing. Schaefer and his AMS
            associates hoped to cultivate a love of learning and passion for discovery that would
            encourage teens to follow scientific career paths. Although the program began as a
            males-only endeavor, it eventually welcomed females into its ranks later in the
            1960s.</p>
          <p>The Loomis School summer sessions (also known as the Atmospheric Sciences Program)
            became so successful that the Charles F. Kettering Foundation gave it financial backing
            in the early 1960s. As director, Schaefer was then able to expand the program to include
            field stations around the country so that more young people could participate and the
            opportunities for hands-on experimentation and discovery multiplied considerably. Within
            a couple of years of the program’s beginning, Schaefer’s work attracted the attention of
            Dean Oscar Lanford and President Evan Collins of what was then the New York State
            Teachers College. As the Teachers College expanded into the present-day State University
            of New York at Albany in the 1960s, the summer science program moved under the auspices
            of the school and became known as the Natural Sciences Institute, or NSI, which
            flourished through the 1960s as it welcomed college students to its ranks. Schaefer
            phased out the NSI in the early 1970s after determining that the program had met its
            goals.</p>

            <p>In addition to serving on the Education Committee of the American Meteorological
              Society, Schaefer also served on the general council of the AMS. This subseries
              features documents on the AMS educational films project, correspondence, a few AMS
              bulletins, and some programs from annual AMS meetings. Although the files do not
              directly relate to the founding of the Loomis School/NSI, the AMS was responsible for
              the founding of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the Loomis School in 1959, and the
              documentation of educational programs found in this subseries foreshadows the creation
              of those summer sessions.</p>

            <p>As director of the Loomis School activities, and ultimately as director of research
              at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York,
              Albany, Schaefer kept records pertaining to the operation of the program. There are
              many correspondence files; some are between Schaefer and colleagues while others are
              between Schaefer and the students from the summer program. Numerous students kept in
              touch with Schaefer well beyond the years that they participated in the Atmospheric
              Sciences Program, and many of them became successful professionals in their own right. </p>
            <p>Researchers will also find curriculum planning documents, teaching aids, field site
              information, and applications and invitation reply forms from students. Please note
              that some folders in this subseries are restricted due to individual student
              information contained therein.</p>

            <p>As the Atmospheric Sciences Program flourished at the Loomis School, Schaefer and his
              colleagues decided to expand the students’ educational opportunities by offering the
              summer session in multiple locations across the United States. While Schaefer, as
              director, would make appearances and coordinate the activities at each site—called
              field stations—the day-to-day running of each one depended on the talent of the highly
              reputable scientists Schaefer hired for that purpose. Initially, the field stations
              were located in New York (Whiteface Mountain), Colorado (Boulder), and Arizona
              (Flagstaff). Eventually, more sites were added, including Socorro, New Mexico and
              Rensselaerville, New York. Schaefer’s contacts from General Electric and Munitalp
              played a helpful role in establishing field stations and attracting accomplished staff
              members for the summer program.</p>
            <p>The files in this subseries are a mix of more correspondence, student reports,
              charts, graphs, and other data from daily experiments, and occasionally photos of the
              students as they performed educational tasks or enjoyed recreational time.</p>

            <p>Schaefer retained many notebooks kept by the students who participated in the
              Atmospheric Sciences Program, as well as some of their final papers that detail the
              projects they worked on for eight weeks. Encouraged by Schaefer to do self-directed
              experiments, the students kept logs of observations and measurements to aid them in
              their final reports to staff and peers. A few also sketched illustrations to accompany
              their notes. Some of the papers in this subseries are final reports of the students’
              experiments while others are thoughts and reflections on the experience as a
              whole.</p>

            <p>This last subseries contains official reports by Schaefer on the activities of the
              Atmospheric Sciences Program and records its progress as it transforms into the
              Natural Sciences Institute at the State University of New York, Albany. Some of the
              reports cover the summer program as a whole, while others focus specifically on field
              station issues. There are also articles published by current and former students of
              the program as well as some articles published by Schaefer himself.</p>

          <p>Schaefer’s connection with the University at Albany began in 1959 when the school was
            still known as the New York State Teachers College, located in downtown Albany. When
            Schaefer began the highly successful Atmospheric Physics Program via the Loomis School
            in Connecticut, he attracted the attention of Dean Oscar Lanford and President Evan
            Collins of the New York State Teachers College. They asked Schaefer to come teach at
            their Albany school, and within his first year as a faculty member, the idea for the
            Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) was born. Officially established in February
            1961, it was originally located in the old General Electric hangar at Schenectady
            Airport. Although the former New York State Teachers College expanded to the current
            uptown Albany campus in the mid-1960s, officially becoming the University at Albany,
            State University of New York, the ASRC remained centered in Schenectady at that time.
            Meanwhile, the Atmospheric Physics Program that began at the Loomis School shifted to
            Albany to be under the sponsorship of the ASRC, where it became the Natural Sciences
            Institute (NSI). However, since the program’s roots were not originally with the ASRC
            and University at Albany, those records comprise their own series within this collection
            (Series #5).</p>
          <p>The ASRC was designed in memory of the atmosphere that Schaefer enjoyed at the General
            Electric Research Laboratory in the 1930s and 1940s, where scientists were allowed
            plenty of freedom to conduct their experiments and Director Willis Whitney asked each
            day if his researchers were having fun. Besides conducting their own original research,
            ASRC scientists were always in contact with other professionals around the United States
            and internationally, sharing their research and collaborating on new ideas. The Center
            was also an ideal location for budding scientists from the University at Albany to
            collaborate with professionals. Schaefer brought some of the best scientists of the day
            to the ASRC thanks to his contacts from General Electric and Munitalp. Ray Falconer,
            Bernard Vonnegut, and Duncan Blanchard all became part of the ASRC family as it grew
            from the G.E. airplane hangar, to a building at 100 Fuller Road by the SUNY Albany
            uptown campus (1978), and finally to 251 Fuller Road (1997) where it is part of the
            Center for Environmental Sciences and Technology Management (CESTM).</p>
          <p>Although Schaefer was the principle founder of the ASRC, Dr. David Barry and Dr. Eugene
            McLaren were among the first directors while Schaefer was director of research (and
            chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee.) However, Schaefer became overall
            director in 1965, a position he held until his retirement from the ASRC and teaching in
            1976. Given the title of Professor Emeritus, he remained an advisor to the ASRC for
            years after.</p>

            <p>The majority of the administrative files consist of correspondence; as director of
              research and then overall director of the ASRC, Schaefer was in constant contact with
              administrators of SUNY Albany, local colleagues, and other professionals in the field.
              There are also documents dealing with budget issues, grant applications, conferences,
              and operation of the N.S.I. field stations.</p>

            <p>Schaefer saw research opportunities via the ASRC that promised to have national and
              even international implications as environmental concerns became more public in the
              1960s and 1970s. He was engaged frequently to speak about his research, both to other
              professionals and to “everyday” people who might be interested in learning more about
              issues like acid rain or solar energy. He also participated on committees and
              commissions who were given the responsibility of investigating scientific dilemmas of
              the day and presenting findings to the government. This subseries contains materials
              from those speaking engagements, trips, and committees.</p>

            <p>Although Schaefer had administrative duties as director of research, as well as
              overall director of the ASRC in later years, he still made as much time as possible
              for conducting his own research. In addition to experiments carried out in New York’s
              Capital Region, he oversaw research at the Whiteface Mountain Field Station and
              Observatory as well as Flagstaff, Arizona, and led highly successful expeditions in
              the Yellowstone National Park. His fascination with particle studies continued during
              his ASRC years, leading to crucial investigations of carcinogens, acid rain, effects
              of particulate matter on global weather, aerosol studies, and much more. He also took
              great interest in alternative energy sources, solar energy specifically. Of course,
              cloud studies and ice-forming nuclei also remained a passion of Schaefer’s. This
              subseries mainly consists of Schaefer’s own investigations into those kinds of topics
              and offers a glimpse of his own notes, calculations, and observations on the subjects
              of interest to him.</p>

            <p>The Desert Research Institute, or D.R.I., was established in 1959 as part of the
              University of Nevada (currently called the Nevada System of Higher Education). Their
              mission calls for a blend of traditional, basic research with interdisciplinary,
              applied research methods. Although Schaefer did not have a hand in creating the
              D.R.I., he did act as a consultant for them during his time at the ASRC/SUNY. His
              Natural Sciences Institute also expanded to include a field station at the D.R.I., so
              this subseries is a blend of Schaefer’s consulting materials as well as applications
              and curriculum planning for the N.S.I. summer programs.</p>

            <p>Among Schaefer’s most successful ventures via the ASRC was the Yellowstone Field
              Expeditions. In 1960, Schaefer met with National Park Service members in Wyoming’s
              Grand Tetons to discuss the possibility of leading scientific studies in Yellowstone
              National Park. Specifically, he was interested in the behavior of supercooled clouds
              that form in the area of Old Faithful. Clouds and condensation nuclei were still a
              fascination of Schaefer’s long after his G.E. days, and he foresaw many different
              kinds of scientists—including cloud physicists—gathering at Yellowstone once a year to
              devote themselves to conducting experiments, making observations, and comparing
              outcomes.</p>
            <p>January 1961 saw the first Yellowstone Field Research Expedition (YFRE) come and go
              with great success. Schaefer took care to invite scientists who likely knew each other
              by reputation but had not had the chance to meet, thereby cementing new professional
              relationships as well as friendships. He also tried to invite scientists of all ages
              and backgrounds so that new professionals would benefit from the experience of those
              who were more seasoned, and scientists from assorted specialties could share their
              expertise all around. Generally, the expeditions began shortly after the new year and
              lasted four weeks. Participants could stay all month or come for a portion of it. </p>
            <p>As founder of the program, Schaefer nearly always stayed the entire time, with the
              exception of the last couple of years when he left early to see if the remainder of
              the expedition would run smoothly without him. While the program ran efficiently in
              terms of the participants involved, atmospheric conditions had changed since
              Yellowstone officials began allowing snowmobiles in the park in 1965. The effect on
              the environment was detrimental to the scientists’ studies, and drastic changes in the
              administration of the park added to the YFRE woes. The last expedition occurred in
              1971 despite Schaefer’s original intentions to continue the program. He shifted
              studies to Northern Arizona and Southern Utah in the summertime for purposes of
              analyzing air pollution and land use, but that program lasted just two years.</p>
            <p>This subseries contains administrative papers dealing with the operation of the YFRE
              as well as Schaefer’s own notes, calculations, and photographs of his work at the
              Yellowstone National Park. Although there is a separate subseries for ASRC reports and
              publications, those pertaining specifically to the Field Expeditions are included in
              this subseries. Please note that there are two photo albums in this subseries that are
              housed in a separate, oversized box.</p>

            <p>This subseries includes reports and publications by Schaefer, his colleagues at the
              ASRC, and colleagues from other institutions who worked closely with Schaefer and
              occasionally collaborated with the ASRC. Names from the latter group will sound
              familiar from Schaefer’s consulting materials, such as Wendell Mordy and Paul
              MacCready. Topics range from annual ASRC reports, to solar energy work, to particle
              studies and more. Some documents are official reprints of articles while others are
              handwritten manuscripts or typescripts.</p>

            <p>In addition to traditional photos, the photographs subseries also contains negatives
              and photo slides. Topics include the environment, chemistry, electrostatics, ice and
              snow, and world travel. While some of the images in this subseries are directly
              related to Schaefer’s professional work, others are likely derived from
              extracurricular activities he engaged in while taking photographs for business
              purposes. Schaefer never did like to let an opportunity go by to explore things that
              were of interest to him. Some topics, like the Yellowstone Field Expedition, exist as
              their own subseries elsewhere. In the interests of preserving original order, however,
              those images were not pulled from this subseries.</p>
            <p>Researchers might note that the dates of this subseries span far more than Schaefer's
              ASRC years. Although some of the photos, slides, and negatives are from G.E.,
              Munitalp, and consulting jobs, Schaefer certainly drew upon his past resources while
              working for the University at Albany/ASRC. He also stayed on in an advisory capacity
              after his official retirement, which is why there are images that post-date 1976.</p>

          <p>In 1964 The Institute on Man and Science in Rensselaerville, New York invited Vincent
            Schaefer to serve on the faculty of scientists and humanists for its July summer
            program. Established in 1962 as an educational center to encourage life-long learning
            and explore ideas about human problems, the Institute changed its name in the 1980s to
            The Rensselaerville Institute to reflect its broader focus on local self–help programs,
            small town revitalization efforts, innovation in government, and cultural and
            educational programs. The Institute remains in existence today. In addition to Schaefer,
            participants and faculty of the Institute on Man and Science included a Supreme Court
            Justice, Nobel Prize recipients, award-winning authors, scientists, economists, and a
            former Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
          <p>This initial invitation in 1964 led to a three decades-long relationship between the
            Institute, Schaefer, and his wife Lois. Based upon his experiences on the 1964 summer
            program faculty, Schaefer subsequently established a Natural Sciences Institute field
            unit in Rensselaerville the following year. Students attended all of the 1965 summer
            program lectures at The Institute on Man and Science. Schaefer continued to serve as a
            faculty member for educational programs, was on the Research and Development Committee,
            advised the Institute about science more generally, became an Associate of the Institute
            in 1971, and by the mid-1970s began many years of service on the Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>This series includes materials related to Schaefer’s varied and long-term service to
            the Institute. There is correspondence, both general and Trustee-specific, literature
            about the Institute and its programs, and a small number of newsletters. There are
            Trustee semi-annual meeting materials, the majority kept by Schaefer in the form of
            complete meeting packages given to Trustees during the Spring or Fall meeting. There are
            minutes from the Executive and Finance Committees, some of which Schaefer saved
            individually, and others he kept within the Trustee meeting packets. In addition,
            Schaefer retained reports about the Institute’s community renewal work in small towns,
            including Stump Creek, Pennsylvania and Corbett, New York.</p>

            documents relating to the Natural Sciences Institute field unit in Rensselaerville.</p>

          <p>One area of Vincent Schaefer's life that truly blended his personal interests and
            professional pursuits is environmental activism. Schaefer had a devotion to the outdoors
            from a very young age, both in terms of participating in recreational activities and
            regarding conservation efforts. His choice of atmospheric science and chemistry as his
            profession gave him the opportunity not only to spend extra time out in the elements,
            but also offered the chance to become an expert in environmental issues that he could
            then pursue in his spare time. The materials in this subseries highlight some of the
            activities and issues that most captured Schaefer's interest.</p>

            <p>Located in Rensselaerville, New York, the widow and heirs of local businessman E.N.
              Huyck established the Edmund Niles Preserve and Biological Research Station in his
              memory in 1931. This non-profit organization remains dedicated to preservation,
              education and research and to offering visitors a tranquil setting.</p>
            <p>Vincent Schaefer was actively involved with the Huyck Preserve and part of its
              decision-making process for many decades. He joined the Scientific Advisory Committee
              of the organization in the mid-1950s and was elected to the Board of Directors for the
              first time in 1971. He also headed the Long-Range Planning Committee in the early- to
              mid-1980s.</p>
            <p>This series documents Schaefer’s ongoing activities with the Huyck Preserve. There
              are minutes, agenda and correspondence related to his committee and Board service.
              Many of these records discuss land preservation and maintenance. The Scientific
              Advisory Committee also selected summer PhD researchers from applications submitted by
              faculty at colleges and universities across the country, and there are records
              reflecting this process in the subseries. Of interest to researchers may be documents
              addressing the founding of the Natural Sciences Institute field unit in
              Rensselaerville in 1965, a topic related to The Institute on Man and Science (Series
              7) as well.</p>

            <p>In late 1974 Vincent Schaefer began conducting air quality studies in the Shawangunk
              Moutains of New York, located 90 miles north of New York City, as part of his research
              at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. This was his first visit to the Mohonk
              Preserve, then known as The Mohonk Trust.</p>
            <p>The origins of the Preserve extend back to 1869, when the Smiley family purchased
              Mohonk Lake and later established the Mohonk Mountain House. In 1963 Smiley family
              members and several House guests established a separate non-profit organization, The
              Mohonk Trust, to protect and manage the land for public enjoyment and conservation.
              The Trust, renamed the Mohonk Preserve in 1978, was the first land trust with the
              mission of protecting the Shawangunk Ridge and one of the oldest land conservation
              organizations in the Hudson Valley.</p>
            <p>Schaefer’s air quality research introduced him to the Smiley family and he took an
              active interest in Mohonk during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. He was elected to
              the Board of Trustees of The Mohonk Trust in early 1977. He later was a member of the
              Board of Directors of the Monhonk Preserve, serving on the Science and Long-Range
              Planning Committees.</p>
            <p>This series features materials related to Schaefer’s service as a trustee, director,
              and committee member. It also includes Schaefer’s air quality studies conducted during
              1974-1976 and research reports from other scientists related to the area. </p>

            <p>As a life-long resident of Schenectady County, Vincent Schaefer was very vocal about
              preserving the purity of the land and water of the Great Flats Aquifer which provided
              the drinking water for the majority of the county and once served as very fertile
              farmland. </p>
            <p>In the mid-1970s, Rochester-based developer Wilmonite Inc. first proposed a site for
              building a new shopping mall over the aquifer, but the town rejected this initial
              location in 1977 and 1979. The town ultimately approved a new nearby site, and
              Wilmonite developed the Rotterdam Square Mall, which opened in 1988. However, during
              the intervening years, Schaefer and many other residents were adamantly opposed to the
              Mall, citing environmental, economic and cultural concerns. Schaefer was a member of
              The Society for the Preservation of Water Resources, Inc., which formed in 1981, to
              protect the area’s water resources and educate citizens about potential hazards that
              might affect drinking water. The Society included many fellow scientists and engineers
              with technical backgrounds that could conduct their own studies and explain the
              implications to area residents. Schaefer also feared the Mall’s impact on historic
              sites that must be torn down or be otherwise adversely affected by the new Mall, the
              potential for flooding, the issues with water runoff, and the decision to build the
              Mall in a suburban area rather than revitalize downtown Schenectady businesses.</p>
            <p>The subseries includes Schaefer’s scientific studies, his historic surveys and
              research, correspondence, especially his letters to the editor, his 1979 newspaper
              series in the Schenectady Gazette designed to educate fellow residents about the
              importance of the Great Flats Aquifer, newspaper clippings, maps and photographs. Very
              few of these materials were initially in folders so the archivist elected to retain
              the small number of folders and titles and then arranged the remainder of the
              materials in chronological order in folders labeled Great Flats Aquifer.</p>
            <p>Please see the finding aid for APAP-061 for the records of the Society for the
              Preservation of Water Resources for more specific information about this
              not-for-profit organization.</p>

            <p>This subseries includes files documenting Vincent Schaefer’s varied environmental and
              outdoor activities that are not associated with a particular organization, such as the
              Huyck Preserve or Mohonk, or a specific legal effort like the fight to preserve the
              Great Flats Aquifer. Materials include maps, correspondence, photographs, draft
              manuscripts, and news clippings. Of interest are folders devoted to the Mohawk Valley
              Hiking Club, which Schaefer helped found, and his vision for the Long Path, which he
              saw as a trail for hikers stretching from northern New Jersey through the Adirondacks
              passing landmarks along the way. Schaefer published articles in this subseries as an
              individual who loved, studied and appreciated nature, and not as a scientist for
              General Electric, Munitalp, or the ASRC. Therefore articles in this series span his
              lifetime. Researchers should note his “Five Rivers Rambles” ongoing series for the
              Knickerbocker News, written during the early 1970s. In his column, Schaefer explored
              timely topics, such as air pollution, but also area locations of natural beauty and
              wonder, including Gore Mountain, the Helderbergs, and Pine Plains.</p>

            <p>The photographs in this subseries date from Schaefer's teenage years all the way
              through his retirement after he left the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. Having
              a love and deep respect for the outdoors from a young age, Schaefer participated in
              organized activities like the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club, but he also incorporated
              spontaneous outdoor adventures into his busy schedule whenever he could. Sometimes
              this meant a day or afternoon exploring areas in and around the Capital Region; other
              times it meant taking time to explore while he was away on business. His work for
              General Electric, Munitalp, and the State University at Albany/ASRC (not to mention
              his extensive consulting) offered ample opportunities to venture into mountain ranges,
              deserts, plains, valleys, and forests to pursue environmental studies that were of
              interest to him.</p>
            <p>This subseries includes many photo negatives and slides in addition to traditional
              photographs and are identified as such in their folder titles.</p>

          <p>The location of correspondence in this collection is based on how the archivist found
            the materials as donated by Schaefer. Although he filed a considerable amount of
            correspondence within materials from specific affiliations (ex. General Electric,
            Munitalp, consulting work), the archivist found still more correspondence boxed
            separately. Roughly half of these items were not subdivided or specially categorized in
            any way while others were foldered by topic. This arrangement has been retained by the
            archivist. Please note that this series contains letters, cards, and postcards that span
            the majority of Schaefer’s life, from young adulthood to the weeks before he died in
            July 1993. Some are professional in nature while others are from friends and family.</p>

            <p>These letters were not previously sorted out by Schaefer before he donated them to
              the archive, and like the correspondence in subseries #1, they span many years and
              have their source in many of Schaefer’s professional and personal activities. To
              expedite progress for researchers, the materials have been organized by year.</p>

          <p>Vincent Schaefer planned to write a book on the atmosphere for decades. Correspondence
            shows that he brought the idea to Houghton Mifflin Editor-in-Chief Paul Brooks in the
            mid-1950s (Box 1, Folder 40) but the book was not finished at that point. Later,
            Schaefer collaborated with Professor John A. Day of Linfield College, Oregon and Christy
            Day for the final version of the book. Much of their correspondence regarding drafts is
            preserved in this series. The finished product, <title><emph render="italic">A Field
                Guide to the Atmosphere</emph></title>, was published in 1981 in the Roger Tory
            Peterson <emph render="italic">Field Guide</emph> series, an inclusion that generated
            media attention and notoriety. Included in this series are both handwritten and typed
            drafts, proofread copies, correspondence regarding drafts and the finished product,
            individual chapter files along with many photographs, slides and negatives. The
            collection also includes three folders containing files from a collaborative project
            Schaefer worked on titled “Glories of the Sky.” </p>
          <p>Photographs are sleeved where possible. Photocopies of the original layout of notes and
            labels affixed to the photographs are in the folders. While some of the photographs have
            information written on the back, many are blank.</p>
          <p>The series is organized alphabetically and then chronologically where multiple entries
            exist. Oversized material from this series is noted in the box and folder list.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Schaefer donated many films to the archives that are related to his work at General
            Electric, Munitalp, and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center/University at Albany,
            SUNY. There are also some reels that document his consulting work as well as a few that
            cover personal interests such as hiking. Films vary between 16 millimeter and 35
            millimeter, with an emphasis on the latter. Some footage is black and white while other
            footage is in color. There were some film containers that arrived at the archives with
            two ID numbers on them; using Schaefer's own list, the archivist made every attempt to
            follow the creator's original numbering system. Due to time constraints on processing as
            well as the delicate nature of the film reels, most of the footage has not yet been
            viewed by the archivist. Please also note that the film titles are taken directly from
            Schaefer's own labels, which is why many are abbreviated.</p>
          <p>Researchers may access PDF files of Schaefer's original film inventory (first digital
            object) as well as the archives' spreadsheet version of that inventory (second digital
            object) by clicking on the following links: </p>

          <p>These links contain more detailed information about each film such as size, color vs.
            black and white, and added notes, if available. Please note that Film #1 features a link
            to digitized footage of Schaefer working with his famous cold chamber in the General
            Electric Research Laboratory.</p>

          <p>This series contains a variety of materials from Vincent Schaefer’s personal life, some
            of it autobiographical. Subseries one features his unpublished memoir, <emph render="italic">Twenty Years at Langmuir University</emph>, but also family
            photographs, an extensive personal log, and awards. The series also documents his
            passions for hiking, Scouting, skiing, geology, artwork, Dutch Barns, local history and
            archeology.</p>

            <p>The Vincent Schaefer personal subseries comprises material spanning his life and
              career and pertains only to personal interests outside the realms of his atmospheric
              and prescribed research ventures. This subseries contains his schedules and
              itineraries, along with Schaefer’s personal logs from 1947 through 1993. Along with
              Schaefer’s own autobiography Twenty Years at Langmuir University there are timelines,
              resumes, and lists of works published, all created by Schaefer.</p>
            <p>When Schaefer was not conducting research experiments, he had numerous interests and
              hobbies that occupied much of his time such as Scouting with the Lone Scouts and as a
              Boy Scouts of America scoutmaster of a troop in Schenectady, NY, avid participation
              and avocation for conservation of the Adirondacks where he, himself owned a camp,
              Woestyne North. Conservation played a large portion of Dr. Schaefer’s time outside of
              the professional avenues; he advocated for the preservation of the Adirondacks,
              Whiteface and Gore Mountains, the Mohawk Valley area, Vrooman’s Nose in Schoharie
              County and was a member of the Van Epps Hartley chapter of the New York State
              Archeological Association. He was a founding member of the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club.
              Personal items and experiences related to all of these interests are found within this
              subseries.</p>
            <p>This subseries also documents family relationships. There are family photographs and
              correspondence with his wife Lois, their three children, and his younger brother Paul.
              Also included are diaries of family trips, including a cross-country adventure.</p>
            <p>In addition, many of Schaefer’s colleagues wrote reminiscences about their
              experiences and memories; these have been collected and placed in this subseries.
              Among such is a tribute to Schaefer by Duncan Blanchard that appeared in the ASRC
              annual report in 1975-1976. As Schaefer gained international acclaim in the
              atmospheric world, he received many awards and honorary degrees at Notre Dame, York
              University and Siena College.</p>
            <p>Late in life, Schaefer embarked on the project “Ancient Windows of the Earth” which
              involved cutting rocks from across the country into thin slices with a diamond saw.
              The slices transmitted light and also showed the color, pattern and structure of the
              rock. Schaefer often used the rock slices to form unique creations such as windows or
              lampshades. This subseries includes correspondence about the ongoing project, cutouts,
              samples of rock slices, the history of each original creation and the technique of the
              manufacturing.</p>

            <p>This subseries documents Vincent Schaefer’s interests in the construction, history
              and preservation of Dutch barns. Although the majority of the records are from
              Schaefer’s retirement during the late 1980s and early 1990s when he had significant
              time to devote to this pursuit, researching and surveying Dutch barns was a lifelong
              hobby. For example, there are images of barns from the 1930s and a newspaper clipping
              discussing a planned lecture by Schaefer on Dutch barns from January 1939. Schaefer
              was very active in the Dutch Barn Preservation Society and received a Preservation
              League of New York State Award in 1991 for restoration and protection of the Greater
              Wemp Barn. This multi-year effort to save and ultimately relocate the Greater Wemp
              Barn is well-documented in this subseries. Other materials of interest are several
              volumes of Dutch Barn Research Miscellany, a publication edited by Schaefer, articles
              on barns written by Schaefer, background information on barns in New York compiled by
              Schaefer, especially those in the Capital District, and numerous slides and
              photographs.</p>

            <p>This subseries features materials related to history in New York, especially near the
              Capital District, and archeological research, two of Vincent Schaefer’s important
              personal interests. Schaefer was a vice president and trustee of the Schenectady
              County Historical Society and wrote for the organization’s Milestone newsletter. He
              also helped found the Van Epps-Hartley chapter of the New York State Archeological
              Association, which was formally organized in 1931, and later served as chapter
              president. There is significant correspondence about the chapter’s founding and
              several articles authored by Schaefer about archeological sites and artifacts in this
              subseries. There also is correspondence between Schaefer and New York State
              Archeologist Arthur C. Parker, then museum director at the City of Rochester, New
              York’s Municipal Museum.</p>
