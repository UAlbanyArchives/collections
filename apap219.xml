        projects he conducted to sign a clearance form or an agreement, not all interview files
        donated to the archive contain forms. Therefore notes, transcripts and audio of a select
        number of interviews are restricted until clearance may be obtained from the interviewees or

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Ivan D. Steen was a long time professor at the University at Albany. He began his career at
        Hunter College of the City University of New York after completing his schooling at New York
        University, where he received his bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees. After three
        years on the faculty at Hunter College, Steen joined the University at Albany's History
        Department in 1965 as an assistant professor. He became founding director of the
        University's Public History Graduate Program in 1983, an associate professor in 1985 and
        associate professor emeritus in 2010. He also served as Vincent O’Leary Associate Professor
        of History from 2010-2013. During his tenure at the University at Albany, Steen published
        numerous articles and essays, attended and spoke at academic conferences, lectures, and
        panels across the country and internationally, and hosted workshops. He was a member of the
        University Senate as well as a member of United University Professions (UUP). He was elected
        vice president and president of UUP's Albany chapter during the 1990s and early 2000s. Steen
        continues to co-direct the Center for Applied Historical Research at the University. </p>
      <p>Professor Steen is passionate about oral history and local history. As founding director of
        the University's Oral History Program, Steen’s projects often focused on a combination of
        the two. Two of Steen’s major projects were the Erastus Corning Years Oral History Project
        and The Rockefeller Years: An Oral History of the State of New York Under Governor Nelson A.
        Rockefeller. Steen, along with students in the program, worked on other projects pertaining
        to local history such as Albany’s black community, the history of the Fort Orange Club,
        local area Holocaust survivors, and memories of radio personnel. Steen personally conducted
        many interviews as did his research associates and students in the Oral History Program.
        Records of these projects are found in Series 1 along with materials relating to Steen's
        research of former Prisoners of War (POW) from World War I, World War II, the Korean War,
        and the Vietnam War.</p>
      <p>In 2013 Steen officially retired from his positions at the University at Albany.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Ivan Steen Papers document his work at the University at Albany, including his numerous
        oral history projects, research conducted for the projects, and his time as an associate
        professor of History, founding director of the Oral History Program and founding director of
        the Public History Graduate Program. This collection is divided into two series. The first
        series, Oral History and Research Files, is arranged alphabetically while the second series,
        University at Albany History Department, is arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>The Oral History and Research Files series contains audio cassette tapes, transcripts,
        notes and related correspondence of the interviews conducted by Steen, his colleagues, and
        his students. Steen's research materials for his multiple oral history projects are housed
        in this series as well. Researchers should note that material pertaining to the Public
        History and Oral History Programs are found within the first series, as these programs often
        produced the work found in said series. Steen’s History Department records, which include
        memorandum, meeting minutes, correspondence, and reports are retained in Series 2.</p>
      <p>Researchers should note that some materials Professor Steen donated were moved to separate
        collections because he created these records as a member or officer of an organization and
        not as an individual. Therefore, archivists transferred material pertaining to UUP and the
        University Senate to their respective collections. Archivists also transferred records to
        the UUP Oral History Collection. These collections are all found in this department.</p>
      <p>For related material, please see the Brothers Records, Daniel Evan Button Papers, Dolores
        Carrara Papers, Victor A. Lord Papers, Harold Rubin Papers and Malcolm Wilson Papers.</p>

          <p>Series 1 contains material related to Professor Steen's oral history projects and their
            related material. Two of his major oral history projects were about Albany Mayor Erastus
            Corning 2nd and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Other projects pertain to topics
            such as Albany's black community, the Holocaust, and radio. Please note that formal oral
            history interviews with prisoners of war were never conducted because grant funding
            could not be obtained. Folders typically contain correspondence with each interviewee as
            well as interview transcripts and background information. There are cassette tapes to
            accompany the interview transcripts. Cassette tapes with general dates or date ranges
            indicate multiple interview dates.</p>
