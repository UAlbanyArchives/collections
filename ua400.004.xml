      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>The Deans' and Directors' Meetings were informal meetings attended by deans of academic schools and directors of University facilities with the Academic Vice President presiding.  The exact date at which these meetings began is unknown, but records in this collection begin in 1967.  The purpose of these meetings was to provide and open forum for the discussion of matters of academic and administrative concern to the deans and directors of the University. </p>
      <p>The record group also contains the records of the separate Conference of Deans of Faculties.  The purpose of this group was to "serve as a continuing advisory body to the Vice-President of Academic Affairs."  Specifically, it advised on "allocations of resources, future development of new and established program areas, and educational strategies for achieving University goals." (Memorandum from the Acting Vice-President for Academic Affairs to Charles Colman, et. al., 10/22/1970.)  The Conference of Academic Deans met every other week following the Deans' and Directors' Meetings. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of Deans' and Directors' Meetings are an unofficial record of this group.  This collection has been taken from the files of Dean Warren Haynes, School of Business, Associate Dean Charles Colman, School of Humanities, and circa James Schmidt, Director of University Libraries, as well as other deans and directors.     Included in these files are minutes of meetings, memoranda, extensive documentation on the creation of budgets, allocations, admissions and enrollment figures, numerous reports on tenure and term appointment, and handwritten minutes by the aforementioned Deans and Directors.  In addition, discussion can be found on major issues confronting the University such as student unrest in the late 1960's and the cancellation of many programs at the State University of New York at Albany due to state budget cuts in the mid-1970's.</p>
