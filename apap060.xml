      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Conservative Party of New York State, also commonly referred to as the New York
                State Conservative Party, was officially founded in 1962. Efforts to form the party
                were initiated following the Republican loss of New York State in the 1960
                Presidential Election. In 1961 disaffected Republicans, led by New York City
                attorneys Kiernan O'Doherty and J. Daniel Mahoney, formed the organizing committee
                for the New York State Conservative Political Association, Inc., a membership
                corporation. This association was established as a base upon which to build the
                Conservative Party, "a fourth party, to counter the influence of the New York
                Liberal Party" [Mahoney, J. Daniel, <emph render="italic">Actions Speak
                    Louder</emph> (New York: Arlington House), p. 24]. The Conservative Party's
                intent was to "exercise leverage upon the major political parties by endorsing and
                working for candidates from either party whose views paralleled its own, and running
                its own candidates where acceptable major party candidates were not put forth"
                [Mahoney, J. Daniel, <emph render="italic">Actions Speak Louder</emph> (New York:
                Arlington House), p. 23]</p>
      <p>State headquarters opened in April 1962 as the Conservative Party, Inc. which
                performed the operations of the party through 1962. Due to provisions of the New
                York State Election Law, the party did not become an official political party until
                election day of that year. Red-tape was bypassed by taking over and renaming the
                defunct Freedom Party, Inc. Development of the party began with the creation of
                local party clubs which were viewed as the party's "main political resource"
                [Mahoney, J. Daniel, <emph render="italic">Actions Speak Louder</emph> (New York:
                Arlington House), p. 125]. Interim county committees were formed, and by 1963 there
                was a county chairman for each of New York State's 62 counties. It was not until
                1964 that county committees were elected consisting of two to four members from each
                election district.</p>
      <p>The party's Organizing Committee was redesignated in 1962 as the State Committee and
                a State Executive Committee was created. The State Committee, like the county
                committees, was not duly elected until 1964. It consisted of three members from each
                Congressional district meeting one to two times annually. The State Committee acts
                as a general oversight body for the party. The State Executive Committee, which
                meets on a regular basis, controls the implementation of policy. Party officers
                include the State Chairman, State Vice Chairmen, Secretary and Treasurer. In 1971
                the position of Executive Director was instituted to handle many of the
                administrative details that could no longer be performed by the State Chairman
                alone.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of the Conservative Party of New York State (hereafter referred to as
                CPNYS) include party news releases, bulletins, some State Committee and State
                Executive Committee meeting minutes, election material (such as authorizations and
                designating petitions of party candidates), party legislative programs,
                publications, and news clippings. Information on CPNYS candidates is scattered
                between the Subject Files, which consist primarily of reference material, and the
                official election campaign documents of the Chairman's Subject Files. The most
                complete campaign information is that for James L. Buckley's U.S. Senatorial
                Campaign of 1970. Records related to that campaign are located in the Subject Files
                and Buckley Files.</p>
      <p>The strength of this collection is in the documentation of the CPNYS's positions on
                social, political and economic issues. The most substantive information is in the
                News Releases File. Unfortunately that series contains no records for 1967, 1982,
                1984 and 1985. News releases for these missing years may be found in the Subject
                File. The Position Papers also provide valuable information about the party's
                ideological stance on a limited range of topics (twenty-six). The Legislative
                Programs in the Chairman's Subject Files provide extensive information on the
                political goals of the party and are complete except for a major gap from 1979 to
                1985. Among the printed materials in the Chairman's Subject Files are reprinted
                articles and mass mailings. These documents provide an indication of the party's
                position on a variety of issues.</p>
      <p>Although the records span the period from 1962 to 1988 the bulk of the records covers
                the 1970s and are primarily reference in nature.</p>
      <p>An additional 6 cubic feet of records were deposited in August 2004, August 2006,
                October 2006, and November 2006, but are not yet described in this finding aid.</p>
