      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>John H. E. Fried (1905-1990), lawyer, professor and human rights activist, came to
                the United States in 1938 from Vienna, Austria shortly after its annexation by
                Hitler. Before immigrating to the United States, Fried, who received his Doctor of
                Law and Political Science from the University of Vienna in 1930, was a member of the
                Vienna Bar and also served a five-year term as panel member of the Vienna Labor
                Relations Court.</p>
      <p>Upon his arrival in New York in the summer of 1938, Fried joined the Institute for
                Social Research of Columbia University. During the course of the next few years, he
                wrote three highly acclaimed books (The Guilt of the German Army, 1942; The
                Significance of Democracy: Constitutional Developments and Labor Relations in
                Austria, 1944; and The Exploitation of Foreign Labor by Germany, 1945), obtained a
                Ph.D. in Public Law and Government from Columbia University, held posts as Research
                Associate at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research, taught at
                City College and the Extension Department of Columbia, and became a senior official
                of the international secretariat of the International Labor Organization (I.L.O.),
                located in Montreal, Canada.</p>
      <p>In January of 1947, the U.S. War Department requested Fried's services for a
                three-month survey of certain aspects of the law of war, and to serve as Consultant
                to the U.S. Secretary of War, assigned to the U.S. War Crimes Tribunals in
                Nuremberg, Germany. In March 1947, Fried was asked to remain in Nuremberg as Special
                Legal Consultant to the U.S. Judges at the trials, to advise on questions relating
                to all aspects of the law of war and war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes
                against peace, as well as many other questions of international law. After the
                trials ended in Spring 1949, Fried, by decision of all presiding judges, was made
                their representative for the preparation of the official U.S. government publication
                of these trials. He was transferred to the Judge Advocate General's Office,
                Department of the Army, The Pentagon, where he worked until the end of 1950. The
                proceedings of the 12 trials were published in 14 volumes, Trials of War Criminals
                before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals (Washington: U.S. Government Printing
                Office, 1950-1953), with the introduction to each of the twelve cases stating: "John
                H. E. Fried, Special Legal Consultant to the Tribunals, reviewed and approved the
                selection and arrangement of the material as the designated representative of the
                Nuremberg Military Tribunals."</p>
      <p>Over the next three decades, Fried held academic positions at the City College of New
                York, Columbia University, Pittsburgh University, the New School for Social Research
                (NY), and from 1968 until his retirement as Professor of Political Science at the
                Lehman College, Graduate Faculty of the City University of New York. He continued to
                serve the international community, working for the United Nations in various
                capacities, as Legal Officer and Program Officer of the Technical Assistance
                Administration of the U.N., as Legal Advisor (on international law) to the
                Government of Nepal, and lastly as U.N. Non-Governmental Organization Representative
                of the Foundation for the Establishment of an International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p>In addition to his book publications, Fried presented numerous lectures and papers at
                universities, national and international conferences. Seven papers were selected
                from the John H.E. Fried Papers and published in 1994 as Toward a Right to Peace.
                Selected Papers of John H. E. Fried. With a foreword by Roger S. Clark (Northampton,
                MA: Aletheia Press, c1994). Additional collections of materials pertaining to John
                H. E. Fried are located at the Leo Baeck Institute (NY) and the Simon Wiesenthal
                Center of Yeshiva University of Los Angeles.</p>

            <p>This series contains materials and texts for what Fried called his
                            "Nuremberg book project", which he formally titled Human Rights and
                            International Justice. The book was never published although Fried
                            continued to work on various versions of the text over many years.</p>
