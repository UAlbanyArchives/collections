      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>Founded in 1970, the mission of the Pride Center of the Capital Region is to promote the well-being of all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer-identified people and those affected by discrimination based on gender identity and expression. Based in Albany, the Pride Center meets the diverse needs of LGBTQ people in a ten county region. Their programs, both at the Center as well as held throughout the region, meet the health and human service needs of the LGBTQ community as well as educate and advocate for those needs in the broader Capital Region. As the oldest continuously-operating LGBTQ community center in the country, the Pride Center has worked to build a welcoming and empowering community for all people.</p>
