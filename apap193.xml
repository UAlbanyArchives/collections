      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Correctional Association of New York was founded in 1844 by John W. Edmonds, President
        of the Board of Inspectors at Sing Sing Prison [Unless otherwise noted, all information is
        taken from <emph render="italic">The Correctional Association of New York, A History:
          1844-1989</emph>]. Originally named the Prison Association of New York, the organization
        was formed to ameliorate the conditions of criminal defendants and prisoners, improve the
        discipline and administration of local jails and state prisons, and furnish assistance and
        encouragement to reformed convicts after discharge. It is the only private organization in
        the state that has the power to conduct on-site examinations of state and local correctional
        facilities and report its findings and recommendations to governmental authorities ["The
        Correctional Association of New York: A Public Interest Criminal Justice Membership
        Organization", in Resources Committee-Cocktail Part, 1982, folder, in Series 1, Board of
        Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>Since 1846, it has been charged with submitting an annual report on prison conditions in
        New York State to the New York State Assembly.</p>
      <p>The Association has always furnished aid to male and female prisoners. However, roughly a
        decade after its foundation a number of members became convinced that the special needs of
        female offenders were not being addressed. Led by Issac G. Hopper, the chair of the
        Association's Female Department, they left the Association and formed their own group, the
        Women's Prison Association of New York ["Draft-Scope of the Association's Activities", circa
        1975, in Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1, Board of Directors
        Files, 1942-88. For more information about this organization, see: Women's Prison
        Association and Home, 150 Years in the Forefront: The Women's Prison Association and Home
        (1995). Available [online]:
        http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/chronicl/wpa/html/wpaopen.htm [13 April 2000]].</p>
      <p>During the nineteenth century, the organization took a leading role in prison reform in the
        United States and the world. It formed the National Prison Association (now the American
        Prison Association), a nationwide umbrella organization, in 1870. Two years later, it
        started the International Prison Congress, a world-wide gathering of prison officials and
        social reformers that met every five years. The League of Nations eventually assumed
        responsibility for running the conferences, which are now held under the auspices of the
        United Nations.</p>
      <p>The Association was active in promoting numerous criminal justice system reforms in New
        York State. The organization was instrumental in creating New York State's first probation
        and parole systems (c.1875) and pressed for the creation of separate facilities for youthful
        offenders (1864-74) and a separate juvenile justice system (1874-1904) ["A Brief Description
        of the Correctional Association's Purpose, History, Recent Publications, Current Program",
        in Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1, Board of Directors Files,
        1942-88, and untitled typescript notes beginning with "Parole/Probation", in Correctional
        Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1, Board of Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>The Association sought to ensure that prisoners had opportunities to acquire formal
        education and advocated the creation of prison libaries (1904-24). It also fought to ensure
        that prisoners could learn a trade while incarcerated and that their labor was not
        exploited. Other policies the Association advocated included: a prison classification
        system; opposition to corporal punishment (1844-64); the Presidential Commutation Act;
        special care facilities for inmates afflicted with tuberculosis; establishment of a
        psychiatric clinic at Sing Sing Prison; creation of the New York City Parole Commission;
        establishment of prison libraries (1904-24); development of policies which enabled prisoners
        to contribute to the war effort by working in war-related industries (1940-42);
        establishment of a Crime Victims Compensation Board (1965-66); creation of an adequate
        public defender system [. The Prison Association of New York, One Hundred Years of Faithful
        Service, 1844-1944 (New York: The Prison Association of New York, 1944), 3-7. A copy of this
        publication is housed in the Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1,
        Board of Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the organization advocated the establishment of a Crime Victims
        Compensation Board (1965-66) and pressed for the decriminalization of pornography, sexual
        acts between consenting adults, and other crimes it deemed "victimless" ["Draft-Scope of the
        Association's Activities", circa 1975, in Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder,
        in Series 1, Board of Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>Recent activities of the Association include the AIDS in Prison Project, the Public Policy
        Project, the Prison Overcrowding Project, the Prison and Jail Conditions Project, and the
        Prison Visiting Committee (1980-present). The Association has also been active in efforts to
        educate the public about the immense costs incurred by city, county, and state correctional
        agencies and to promote alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders ["The
        Correctional Association of New York: A Public Interest Criminal Justice Membership
        Organization"].</p>
