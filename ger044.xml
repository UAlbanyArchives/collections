      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>According to Arnold Brecht, a contemporary of Hula at the New School for Social
                Research, Erich Hula was "one of the most influential colleagues in the
                administrative and scholarly development of the Graduate Faculty of the New School
                for Social Research, which he joined in 1938 after his arrival as a fugitive from
                Nazi-occupied Austria". With the exception of a semester at Cornell University
                (Spring 1953) and a year at the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research of The
                Johns Hopkins University (1957/1958), Hula spent his entire teaching career, from
                1938 until 1967, at the New School, where he also served continuously from 1942
                until retirement on the editorial board of <emph render="italic">Social
                    Research</emph> as well as a two-year term as Dean of the Graduate Faculty from
                1948-1950.</p>
      <p>Erich Hula was born in Vienna, Austria on May 27, 1900, where he also received his
                formal education in jurisprudence and political science. Hula studied under Hans
                Kelsen and was awarded a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Vienna in 1924.
                Hula was able to continue his studies from 1927 to 1930 in England, France and the
                United States under a Rockefeller grant. After completion of his studies, Hula was
                once again taken under the wing of Hans Kelsen and became his assistant (1931-1933)
                at the Institute of International Law in Cologne, Germany. Hula's admiration for
                Kelsen and his work can be seen in the large volume of Kelsen materials collected in
                the Hula Papers, which include correspondence, notes and published materials.</p>
      <p>In July of 1933, Hula married Annemarie Sporken, and for he next several years held
                posts with the Chambers of Labor in both Graz and Vienna, Austria. Shortly after the
                National Socialist takeover of Austria in 1938, Hula received an offer to join the
                Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, and on March 12, Hula left
                Austria with his wife and immigrated to the United States via Czechoslovakia,
                Switzerland and Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Although Hula produced only one full-length book during his career (a collection of
                his essays), he wrote numerous essays on a variety of subjects: international law
                and international institutions, in particular the League of Nations and its
                successor the United Nations, national self-determination, punitive war and war
                crimes, as well as essays on the problems of individual countries, including
                Austria, Germany, Great Britain and many on the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>Erich Hula died in the Bronx, New York, on May 18, 1987.</p>
