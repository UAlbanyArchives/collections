      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p> Alexander Semmler was born in Dortmund, Germany, on 12 November 1900. He began
                composing music in adolescence and toured Europe and the United States as a pianist
                at the age of fifteen. He studied piano with Josef Pembaur and composition with
                Gustav Jenner, and later studied philosophy and musicology at the universities of
                Marburg, Berlin, and Munich. He emigrated to the United States as a young man and
                became an American citizen in 1930. Semmler worked as a pianist with the CBS
                Symphony and later as a staff conductor and composer at CBS, writing music both
                under his own name and under the pseudonym Ralph Sandor (or Zandor). He served as
                the American administrator for the Rudfunk im Amerikanischen Sektor (RIAS) in Berlin
                from 1951 to 1952. He was later invited to Mexico, where he was instrumental in
                organizing the Centro de Compositores Mexicanos. From 1955 until 1970, he was the
                New York music director for TRF Music, Inc. and Picture Scores, Inc. During that
                same time, he served as program director of the Maverick Concerts in Woodstock, N.
                Y. Semmler died in Kingston, N. Y., on 24 April 1977. </p>
      <p> The information provided above was gleaned from the following sources, in
                    addition to those found in the Alexander Semmler Papers themselves: <list type="simple"><item>"Semmler, Alexander." Contemporary American Composers: A Biographical
                            Dictionary. Ed. E. Ruth Anderson. Boston: G. K. Hall, 1982.</item><item>"Henry Cowell: Trio for Violin, 'cello, and Piano (1965); Alexander
                            Semmler: Trio for Violin, 'cello, and Piano, Op. 40 (1964)." (see
                            www.newworldrecords.org/uploads/fileuordz.pdf).</item></list>
                </p>
    </bioghist>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection consists primarily of music written by Alexander Semmler, both in
                print and in manuscript. Among the compositions are symphonic works, chamber music,
                and works for various instruments, including piano and voice. There are also
                sketches for later compositions and notebooks with melodic ideas, both titled and
                untitled. The papers also include music written by Mr. Semmler under the pseudonym
                of Ralph Sandor (or Zandor), which is more commercially oriented than those pieces
                signed in his own name. Much of the music in the collection has never been
                published.</p>
      <p>Also included in the papers are certain items kept with his musical compositions by
                Alexander Semmler; these miscellanea are noted in the individual series scope notes.
                Materials are arranged within series either by opus number or alphabetically, if no
                opus number is present (Series 5 is an exception- please see its scope note for
                details). Some of the items include emendations tipped in or fastened with tape.
                Many bear markings or annotations in a hand other than Alexander Semmler's. These
                were not made by the processing archivist. When these markings included dates, those
                were included in the folder listing as approximate dates.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that while there are multiple copies of most of the items in the
                Semmler Papers, these copies are often not identical, as many of the manuscripts
                have corrections or notations by the composer that vary from instance to instance.
                This is why the archivist elected to retain them. Due to the number of fragile and
                oversized items in the collection, materials pertaining to the same work may not be
                housed in the same physical location.</p>

          <p> This series consists of works written by Alexander Semmler for solo piano
                        and organ. Included in this series is a photocopied clipping of a newspaper
                        review of a concert led by Semmler and featuring one of his works. It is
                        housed with the item to which it was originally attached. All items are in
                        English, with musical notations in Italian.</p>

          <p> This series consists of works written by Alexander Semmler for string or
                        chamber orchestra and other chamber ensembles, both with and without piano
                        accompaniment. Also included in this series is a program from a memorial
                        concert given for Semmler, which was stored with the materials. Some items
                        have attached descriptions of their genesis and performance history,
                        possibly intended originally as program notes. These descriptions, all
                        typewritten, may or may not be Semmler's work. Please note that the
                        notations for the Opus 15 and the Opus 16 items are in German. This fact,
                        coupled with the items' original housing in a RIAS folder, would suggest
                        that they were created during Semmler's time with RIAS, although this is not
                        a certainty. </p>

          <p> This series consists of those instrumental works written by Alexander
                        Semmler under his own name that were never assigned an opus number by him.
                        Included in this series is a collection of instrumental works that seems to
                        date from Semmler's youth; this was entitled "Alexander Semmler: Early
                        Instrumental Pieces" by the archivist. These materials are all in German,
                        with Italian notations. Another work in this series is Semmler's "Entre dos
                        Luces", for violin and string orchestra, which is in Spanish with Italian
                        notations. All other materials in this series are in English with Italian
                        notations. Also included in this series are the "Calendar Sketches," music
                        written for sale to home-movie makers to accompany their films. The
                        compositions are accompanied by a typescript describing the purpose of the
                        music and suggesting uses for each piece. It is unclear whether this was
                        written by Semmler.</p>

          <p> This series consists of the vocal and choral works written by Alexander
                        Semmler under his own name. The arrangement of this series is alphabetical
                        except in the case of those works to which Semmler assigned opus numbers;
                        they are arranged under 'O' in numerical order. Please note that the items
                        in Oversized Folder 1 are all in German. All other items are in English,
                        except for some song lyrics in Spanish. Where there is no notation to the
                        contrary, both words and music are presumed to be by Semmler. In all other
                        cases, the lyricist's name is listed first. </p>

          <p> This series includes music written by Alexander Semmler under the name Ralph
                        Sandor (or Zandor). Much of it is more commercially oriented than his other
                        works. This series includes both instrumental and vocal music. As with the
                        vocal music written by Semmler under his own name, when there is a
                        lyricist's name given, it is listed first. </p>

          <p> Arranged in two subseries, the first consisting of manuscript sketches and
                        the second of notebooks. The sketches are arranged alphabetically by folder
                        title; the notebooks are arranged first alphabetically by title and then
                        chronologically. When a folder bore more than one title, the archivist chose
                        the spine title to represent the whole, with any other titles given after a
                        semicolon. Titles that Semmler crossed out were not included in the folder
                        title. Photocopies of Semmler's original folders were included in each
                        folder. Included in this series is "Queen Mystery Cue #12", a piece by
                        Bernard Herrmann originally written for the CBS radio drama "Ellery Queen."
