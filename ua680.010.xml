      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Center for Legislative Development is the successor to the Comparative Development Studies Center. Dr. James Heaphey served as director of the Center for Legislative Development from its founding until 1978 when he was succeeded by Aldo Baakalini who served as Director until his death in 2003. The Center's primary function, under both names, has been and is to assist in the development of legislative effectiveness around the world by studying and accessing legislative needs for resources and information, and formulating plans to acquire those resources so that legislatures can negotiate agreements with their executives. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Contained in the Centers records are program proposals, records of site visits, correspondence, contracts, and reports. In the early 1970s the Center was interested in the problems of legislative security in the United States. Of interest might be extensive documentation, including tapes, of the Legislatures and Human Rights Conference in Dublin, Ireland in 1976. In the 1990s the Center assisted the former Soviet satellite of Hungary in developing legislative institutions, but was largely unsuccessful in attempting to assist the Central Asian Republics in their transition. The Center was fund for a Rule of Law Project in Kazakhstan but internal problems in the country prevent the carrying out of the project. The records also contain proposals for an unfunded Mongolian Rural Civil Society Program, one of whose aims was to enhance the status of women in rural society. The Center had active programs of legislative development in Korea, Kuwait, and Yemen. There are 2.5 cubic ft. of records regarding the Committee on Viable Constitutionalism (COVICO), 1993-1999. In East Africa the Center had a program in Ethiopia in the mid 1970s, in West Africa the Center has had long term programs in Ghana, 1969-1981, in Guinea-Bissau, 1992-1997, and in North Africa, Egypt, 1970s, 1994-98. In the Eastern Mediterranean the Center has had programs in Lebanon. The Center has had a long term presence in South and Central America and the Caribbean from the 1960s through the 1990s. Found in the records are materials relating to the Centers assistance to the following countries to develop their legislative branches: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.</p>
