				All items in this manuscript group were donated to the University Libraries, M.E.
				Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, by the Albany County Planning
				Department on 24 February 1989. The items that were transferred were duplicates from the
				planning department; otherwise, photocopies were made by the archives.

      <p>
				The Albany County Civic Center Collection is an artificial collection assembled by the
				Department of Special Collections and Archives to document the policy decisions that went
				into planning what became the Knickerbocker Arena (later known as the Pepsi Arena). Most
				of the material in this collection was acquired from the Albany County Planning Department.
				A few items were acquired from other sources: The "Draft Environmental Impact Statement"
				of January 1985 was already in the possession of the archives; and the "Report from the
				County Improvements Committee," "Athletic Facilities Improvement Plan" and "Albany Civic
				Center" were duplicates retrieved from the records of the Office of University Advancement,
				the University at Albany, SUNY. The items in this collection are organized chronologically
				to facilitate a reading of the development of the civic center project. 
			</p>
      <p>
				The earliest item in this collection is a "financial and economic analysis for a multiuse
				civic center in Albany County, New York" prepared by Albany County's Improvements Committee.
				This report is followed by early proposals for a civic center, including those from the
				University at Albany, which wanted to cooperate with the county government to plan a civic
				center that could be used by the university and the community as a whole. 
			</p>
      <p>
				Included in this collection is a report from 1984 commissioned by the New York State Urban
				Development Corporation and entitled "Capital District Civic Center--Sports Arena
				Study--Final Report." This report was finished the year after Albany County Executive
				James J. Coyne appointed the Albany County Civic Center Commission to study proposals for
				a civic center.  The report examined the feasibility of having a civic center in the
				Capital Region and evaluated a number of possible sites. 
			</p>
      <p>
				The collection also includes a number of environmental reports (interim, draft and
				final, 1984-1985) submitted to Albany County. These reports studied the previously
				recommended site, east of the Empire State Plaza, and reported on the environmental
				impact the civic center would have on the region. Different site layouts were examined
				as well as related problems, such as increased traffic and noise. 
			</p>
      <p>
				At the end of the collection are a few smaller items, including a 1985 market analysis
				for a proposed 400-room hotel to be located in the southwest quadrant of the civic center
				site. This proposed hotel would accommodate government and commercial clientele, as well
				as people attending conventions and other events at the civic center. There are individual
				Historic American Buildings Surveys, from 1985, for each building that would be demolished
				to clear way for the construction of the civic center. These surveys, which included
				photocopied photographs and descriptions of the buildings, were carried out to ensure that
				none of the buildings were of sufficient historical or architectural value to warrant their
				rescue. The final item in the collection is a 1988 flyer put out by Albany County announcing
				the ongoing construction of the civic center, its attributes and its planned developments
				(including a convention hotel, an additional exhibition hall, and retail and commercial
				office space). The Knickerbocker Arena was completed in late 1989. 
			</p>
      <p>
				There are no problems of conservation in this collection besides the acidity of the
				paper.  The material in the folders entitled "The Capital District Civic Center--Sports
				Arena Study--Final Report" and "Interim Environmental Report" have already been
				photocopied onto acid-free paper. 
			</p>
      <p>
				Parts of this collection are officially stored by three agencies. The Albany County
				Hall of Records holds the environmental impact statements, the New York State Archives
				holds the Historical American Buildings Surveys, and the University at Albany holds
				copies of its own proposals for the civic center.
