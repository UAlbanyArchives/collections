      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>Family Planning Advocates of New York State was established in the 1970s by the affiliates of Planned Parenthood of New York State in an effort to expand the capacity of its organization to affect public policy through lobbying and education. Planned Parenthood affiliates had previously been involved in an organization of family planning activists, the New York State Coalition for Family Planning, organized in 1972. This coalition worked with the administrative branch of state government, but was financially unable to lobby the legislature. In January 1976, the Planned Parenthood affiliates, in conjunction with the New York State Coalition for Family Planning, opened a Family Planning Public Affairs Office. The purpose of this office was to educate lawmakers and the community to the needs and services of family planning providers in New York State; act as a resource to the legislature; and gather and disseminate information to family planning providers and public policy makers.</p>
      <p>In November of 1976 it was decided that in order to make the impact that was thought possible, a greater infusion of money and a stronger commitment to staff would have to be made to the Family Planning Office by its supporters. At the same time it was becoming clear that the Coalition for Family Planning was not able to continue operating with its existing sources of funding. A Transition Committee, comprised of members from Planned Parenthood affiliates and the Board of the Coalition, was appointed in January 1977 to develop a plan to incorporate the functions of the Coalition and the Family Planning Office. The stated purpose of the organization was to represent to the New York State government the views of Planned Parenthood affiliates, other related organizations, and family planning consumers. This would be done by: developing a statewide family planning public policy program; providing statewide public policy leadership; informing members of the legislature and agencies of state government about family planning objectives as related to public policy; informing family planning agencies, other interested groups, organizations, and individuals concerning state legislative proposals and actions; educating the public regarding responsible reproductive activity; and by coordinating litigation when indicated.</p>
      <p>On April 19, 1977, delegates from Planned Parenthood Affiliates, other organizations and individuals met. They agreed to incorporate Family Planning Advocates of New York State as a 501 (c) (4) organization. A slate of officers was elected; members of the Executive Committee were appointed; and by-laws were drafted. A full-time Executive Director, Shirley Gordon, was appointed. A more secure funding base was established with the Planned Parenthood Affiliates committing themselves to assuming the major cost of operation.</p>
      <p>The by-laws of Family Planning Advocates designate all affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. as sustaining members, and designate all other organizations and individuals supporting progressive family planning as non-sustaining members. The by-laws also define the members of the board of directors by duties and powers. The Planned Parenthood affiliates are each represented by one Board member, the sponsoring organization members are as a group represented by 5 board members, and the individual members are as a group represented by 5 board members. The board meets in the fall of each year to elect officers, approve the annual budget of the corporation, and to delegate the duties and authority to individual officers and committees. Directors of the board do not receive any stated compensation but may receive reimbursement for expenses in attending the annual meeting.</p>
      <p>Officers of Family Planning Advocates consist of a president, two vice-presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, "and such additional officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time elect". From the slates provided by the Nominating Committee, the officers are elected at the annual board meeting for a one year term. The president functions as chief executive officer.</p>
      <p>There are four major committees of Family Planning Advocates of New York State. The Executive Committee is composed of the Officers of the Corporation and six additional members, which meets "not less frequently than once every 2 months". Standing Committees consist of three or more members appointed by the Board of Directors with a chair appointed by the president. The Budget and Finance Committee is chaired by the Treasurer and members are selected by the Treasurer. The Nominating Committee, comprised of 5 members, "at least 3 of whom shall be former members or members of the Board of Directors", prepare slates of nominees for the Board of Directors, the officers, the Executive Committee, and the Nominating Committee.</p>

          <p>The text <emph render="italic">Action Impact: A Manual For Family Planning Advocates</emph> published in 1988 by the organization details the manner in which family planning field operators could make legislative and organizational recommendations. The origins of the organization are outlined with a brief history called "Family Planning Advocates of New York State, Inc...How It All Began". The policy folders trace the issues of contraception, teenage pregnancy, parental consent for abortion, infant mortality rates, preventative care, and sex education. These issues were reported by the media and researched by local and federal government departments. The issues contained in the files ultimately were adopted as Family Planning Advocates' policies as recommendations to reproductive organizations and to legislators for state and federal guidelines and laws. Information on legislative activity is found in update sheets and as agenda brochures outlining the schedule and speakers used at issues conferences. This material document how the state legislature was enacting laws and debating issues in conference that would impact the organization's monies and policies. The personnel policies dating from 1979 appear to be the typewritten original document of "Personnel Policies and Practices for Salaried Employees", outlining the employment practices of the organization as it affected the staff. Also in the Administrative series are the minutes of meetings. The minutes are not of the general membership, but of the Executive Committee mostly, interspersed with the minutes of the annual Board meeting. Any documents that were used for focus in the meetings by either the Executive Committee or the Board of Directors are included and affixed to the minutes of the meeting when they were used. There are two alphabetical arrangements of the records in this series - those transferred in 1990 and those transferred in 2004 and 2006. Administrative records including Board and Executive Committee meeting minutes and other materials, particularly from the late 1980s-2000, can be found in the Correspondence series as those documents were mailed to the relevant constituencies.</p>

          <p>Correspondence was sent from Family Planning Advocates of New York State to various organizations and individuals: affiliates and field operators, the Governor of New York State, legislators, and editors of newspapers. Also included is correspondence between the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee, general letters to the membership, letters to presidents of other Family Planning Advocates organizations, letters to physicians connected to public health services organizations, members of the clergy, and press releases. All correspondence is typed and on letterhead and is representative of the communication sent by Family Planning Advocates of New York State to others; little of the correspondence represents what the organization received. Administrative records including Board and Executive Committee meeting minutes and other materials, particularly from the late 1980s-2000, are also interfiled with correspondence as those documents were mailed to the relevant constituencies.</p>
