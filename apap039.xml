      <p>United University Professions (UUP) is the union and collective bargaining agent for
                the faculty and non-teaching professionals of the State University of New York
                (SUNY). As of January 2, 2001, there were 24,322 individuals in the bargaining unit
                UUP represents. [Program, Winter 2001 Delegate Assembly].</p>
      <p>UUP (initially named SUNY/United) was created by the 1973 merger of the Senate
                Professional Association (SPA) and the State University Federation of Teachers
                (SUFT). [United University Professions, Delegate Assembly Minutes, October 12-13,
                1973, 3. For a detailed discussion of the "difficulties" faced by SPA and "several
                decisions and forces that [determined] the course of collective bargaining in SUNY",
                see Herman Doh, "Collective Bargaining in SUNY: The Story of the Senate Professional
                Association", <emph render="italic">Journal of the College and University Personnel
                    Association</emph> (January 1974): 22-39. Another study of collective bargaining
                at SUNY and the competing interests involved is Ebba Wikander McArt, "Common
                Interests as a Basis for Collective Bargaining in the State University of New York
                (SUNY) System", Ph.D. diss. (University of California, Berkeley), 1979. A copy of
                the Doh article is located in Subgroup IV, Office of the Secretary, Series 5,
                Correspondence--Alphabetical Files, "H", 1985. Also by Doh and Stanley Johnson (but
                not included in the collection) is "Collective Bargaining in SUNY: The Experience of
                50 Local SPA Leaders During the First Year", <emph render="italic">Journal of the
                    College and University Personnel Association</emph> 25 (April 1974): 55-73].
                SPA, created in 1970, combined elements from the university-wide Faculty Senate with
                the State University Professional Association (SUPA) which had been created in 1969
                to represent the non-teaching professionals at SUNY. [State University Professional
                Association, Organizational Meeting Minutes, December 12, 1969, 1-2]. In January
                1971 SPA defeated SUFT to become the first elected bargaining representative at
                SUNY. After its election, SPA received certification from the Public Employment
                Relations Board (PERB), the governor-appointed body charged with administering the
                Taylor Law (the 1967 Public Employees' Fair Employment Act that allowed public
                employees in New York to bargain collectively for the first time). It then entered
                into negotiations with the Governor's Office of Employee Relations (GOER; also
                referred to as OER), the state's primary bargaining representative. [E.D. Duryea and
                Robert S. Fisk, <emph render="italic">Collective Bargaining, the State University
                    and the State Government in New York</emph> (Buffalo: The State University of
                New York at Buffalo, 1975), 17-19]. In August 1971, the State of New York and SPA
                signed their first contract. [Duryea and Fisk, <emph render="italic">Collective
                    Bargaining</emph>, 8].</p>
      <p>After its election as bargaining agent, SPA formalized its affiliations with the
                National Education Association (NEA) and its state affiliate, the New York State
                Teachers Association (NYSTA), which represented K-12 teachers throughout New York.
                SPA received both financial and organizational support from NYSTA. The 1973 merger
                between NYSTA and the United Teachers of New York (the New York affiliate of the
                American Federation of Teachers [AFT]) to form New York State United Teachers
                (NYSUT) pressured SPA to merge with SUFT and form UUP. [Duryea and Fisk, <emph render="italic">Collective Bargaining</emph>, 7-8]. UUP voted to end its NEA
                affiliation in 1976 [United University Professions, Executive Board Minutes, June
                25, 1976, 6], and is currently affiliated with NYSUT, the AFT, and the state and
                national AFL-CIO. Like its predecessor SPA, particularly in its earliest years UUP
                received financial and organizational support from NYSUT. It continues to maintain a
                close relationship with NYSUT and to use NYSUT field representatives to handle
                contract and disciplinary grievances, and improper practice charges brought before
                PERB on behalf of its bargaining unit members. UUP's Director of Staff (formerly
                called the Executive Director) and Associate Director of Staff, who oversee the
                field representatives, participate in UUP's contract negotiations, and act in an
                advisory capacity to UUP, are NYSUT employees.</p>
      <p>In its early years, UUP concentrated on establishing its membership and creating a
                position for itself as the collective bargaining agent for all SUNY teaching and
                non-teaching professionals, addressing a concern expressed particularly by
                professionals during the establishment of SPA and then UUP about whether it was
                possible for a union representing both professional and academic staff to adequately
                address the concerns of each group. This issue has persisted, to varying degrees,
                throughout UUP's existence. The diverse nature of the SUNY campuses included within
                the bargaining unit--including university centers, colleges of agriculture and
                technology, and health science centers--has also contributed to the challenges faced
                by UUP in representing the bargaining unit as a collective whole. UUP has twice had
                its position as bargaining agent challenged. In 1974, the Civil Service Employees
                Association (CSEA) unsuccessfully sought to become the bargaining representative for
                non-teaching professionals at SUNY, and in an election conducted by PERB in late
                1978, UUP defeated the NYEA, a New York State affiliate of the NEA, which sought to
                replace UUP as the representative for the entire SUNY bargaining unit.</p>
      <p>UUP's main purpose is to improve the terms and conditions of employment of those it
                represents [United University Professions, Constitution as amended through Fall 1996
                Delegate Assembly]. The primary forum for addressing these issues is the contracts
                that UUP negotiates with the State on behalf of its bargaining unit members [In its
                negotiated contracts and handling of grievances and improper practice charges, UUP
                represents the entire bargaining unit. However, membership in UUP is voluntary,
                although New York State's Agency Fee law enacted in the late 1970s requires that
                every member of the bargaining unit pay dues to UUP. Members of UUP receive
                additional benefits, such as eligibility to vote on negotiated contracts, to
                participate in UUP elections, and various employee benefits, such as life insurance,
                provided by UUP to members only]. Debates over salaries and employee benefit
                packages have figured prominently in past contract negotiations [Duryea and Fisk,
                    <emph render="italic">Collective Bargaining</emph>, 32]. Specific issues of
                concern have included job security, maternity leave, tuition waivers, hiring and
                tenure policies, sabbatical allotments, teaching workloads, student/faculty ratios,
                grievance procedures, parking fees, and expanding retirement investment options. In
                1974, UUP achieved permanent appointment status for professionals, in 1977 it turned
                its focus to family sick leave and sabbatical leave, and in 1978 to the creation of
                minimum salaries for full-time employees. Benefits and sick leave for part-time
                employees also attracted UUP's attention in the late 1970s; pay equity and disparity
                issues were a focus between 1982 and 1985, and geographical differences in cost of
                living were a concern in 1988. In the early 1990s domestic partner care and day care
                coverage were of particular concern to UUP. At the end of the 1990s, new challenges
                were seen in distance learning, rapid changes in technology, privatization issues,
                and the growing use of part-time employees [United University Professions, <emph render="italic">25 Years</emph> (1998), 2-4, 9-10].</p>
      <p>Under the Taylor Law, UUP is forbidden to engage in work actions such as strikes.
                Instead, it uses public demonstrations and publicity when contract negotiations
                stall. UUP also uses these measures to make members of the State Legislature, SUNY
                management, and the general public aware of issues of concern to it, particularly
                cuts in the portion of the state budget allocated to SUNY [United University
                Professions, <emph render="italic">25 Years</emph>, 8]. The prohibition on work
                actions has also meant that from the beginning UUP has devoted itself to political
                action for advancing the interests of those it represents [United University
                Professions, Executive Board Minutes, August 10-11, 1973, 2]. It has registered
                state lobbyists; sponsored its own, and participated in NYSUT-sponsored, "lobby
                days" in Albany; and devoted significant resources to monitoring legislative
                activity and making its positions known to the governor and state legislators. UUP
                also expresses itself politically through candidate endorsements. UUP's affiliation
                with NYSUT broadens its legislative outreach and impact [United University
                Professions, <emph render="italic">25 Years</emph>, 7].</p>
      <p>UUP's other defined goals include advancing education in a democracy and democracy in
                education, and promoting the principles of unity and collective bargaining in higher
                education [United University Professions, Constitution as amended through Fall 1996
                Delegate Assembly]. Its broad range of concerns, primarily expressed through
                resolutions and motions adopted by its Executive Board and Delegate Assembly, have
                included environmental issues; freedom of expression; and the availability of public
                higher education. In the 1990s, coalition building with other higher education
                advocacy groups and community outreach became a focus of UUP's activities [United
                University Professions, <emph render="italic">25 Years</emph>, 9-10].</p>
      <p>UUP has an administrative office headquartered in Albany and chapters based at each
                SUNY campus, as well as at SUNY Central Administration in Albany. Each chapter
                elects delegates to attend the Delegate Assemblies held three times each year. The
                delegates in turn elect six statewide officers (President, Vice President for
                Academics, Vice President for Professionals, Secretary, Treasurer, and Membership
                Development Officer) and the members of UUP's Executive Board. Statewide officers
                are elected for two-year terms and until the Scheuerman administration, were limited
                to six years in office. The presidents of UUP, their campus affiliation, and years
                in office have been as follows:</p>
      <p>Lawrence DeLucia (State University College at Oswego), 1973-1975</p>
      <p>Samuel Wakshull (State University College at Buffalo), 1975-1981</p>
      <p>Nuala McGann Drescher (State University College at Buffalo), 1981-1987</p>
      <p>John M. (Tim) Reilly (State University at Albany), 1987-1993</p>
      <p>William E. Scheuerman (State University College at Oswego), 1993-present</p>

      <p>The records of United University Professions (UUP) document the activities of the
                union and collective bargaining agent for the faculty and non-teaching professionals
                of the State University of New York. They begin in the 1960s with UUP's antecedents,
                the State University Professional Association (SUPA) and the Senate Professional
                Association (SPA), and continue through June 2000 for the materials produced by
                UUP's Communications Department, and through May 1993 (the end of the Reilly
                presidential administration) for most other series.</p>
      <p>Most aspects of UUP's activities are covered by the records, including the actions of
                its policy-making bodies the Delegate Assembly and the Executive Board; the work of
                UUP's standing and ad hoc committees; the activities of UUP's presidents as seen
                through correspondence, subject, and project files; activities on and issues of
                concern to individual campus chapters seen through correspondence between chapter
                representatives and chapter members and UUP's Administrative Office and the
                newsletters created by individual chapters; the records of contract negotiations
                between UUP and the State; correspondence between UUP and SUNY Central
                Administration as well as the Governor's Office of Employee Relations on specific
                labor/management issues; UUP as presented in its publications and advertising
                campaigns; and photographs, video, and audio tape records of many of UUP's
                activities. The records also reflect UUP's continual involvement with other
                organizations interested in higher education, with other educational labor
                organizations both within New York State and nationally, and with organized labor in
                general.</p>
      <p>Not only do the records document the activities of UUP's officers and administrative
                office, they also present the concerns of those UUP represents-the SUNY bargaining
                unit--documented mainly in correspondence and chapter files and in the negotiations
                surveys completed by UUP members commenting on the employment issues of utmost
                concern to them. As UUP has a substantial interest in the function of the State
                University and its funding, many of the records in the collection document the
                activities and policies of SUNY with regard to specific subjects and information on
                the annual SUNY budget.</p>
      <p>One of UUP's functions is to represent the members of its bargaining unit in
                contractual and disciplinary grievances filed with SUNY and OER, and in improper
                practice charges brought before PERB. However, there are no comprehensive records
                regarding these activities included in the collection. The records of UUP's
                Grievance Committee provide some details regarding the grievances UUP has pursued on
                behalf of bargaining unit members, and there is correspondence scattered throughout
                the collection dealing with grievances (although primarily administrative matters
                such as setting hearing dates and filing appeals). The complete grievance and
                improper practice case files remain in UUP's possession.</p>
      <p>The records of UUP are divided into eleven subgroups. The first subgroup, the minutes
                and transcripts of meetings of UUP's Delegate Assemblies, minutes of the meetings of
                UUP's Executive Board, and the minutes of SUPA and SPA, were the first records
                included in this collection. A subsequent processing effort conducted several years
                later resulted in the addition of the ten other subgroups. Access to some series is
                restricted.</p>
      <p>Some topics and activities of UUP are addressed in detail within a single series or
                two, such as Delegate Assemblies, Executive Board meetings, negotiations, committee
                work, chapters, and special projects. However, materials related to each of these
                subjects is also found scattered throughout the various groups of subject and
                project files that make up the collection. While a great deal of overlap exists
                among the various series that make up the collection, for the most part the
                overlapping series do not entirely duplicate each other. In addition, over the
                years, different individuals have used different subject headings for the same
                subjects. The index to the box and folder list provides some guidance on the
                location of materials on the same or similar topics, as do the cross-references
                contained in the various series descriptions.</p>
      <p>An overall theme in the records is UUP's concern with the state's funding of SUNY and
                the impact that cuts in the SUNY budget and, as a result, in campus programs would
                have on bargaining unit members. UUP has also given continual attention to the
                actions of SUNY management and how they impact bargaining unit members, making sure
                that the rights of those it represents are protected. There have also been some
                discernible changes over the years in UUP's interests. For the first decade or so of
                UUP's existence (and during the years of its predecessors), the records reveal a
                concern with the organizational character of the union and increasing its membership
                and, as a result, its power as bargaining agent. Much of the discussion involved
                issues that arose because of the diverse nature of UUP's membership, particularly
                the distinct concerns of non-teaching professionals, as well as librarians and
                health professionals who worked at the various SUNY campuses. In the 1980s UUP began
                to express itself more on social and ideological issues like intellectual freedom
                and the environment, and at times these non-work-related stances prompted complaints
                from members who disagreed with the union's positions, or who felt that UUP should
                not be taking positions on such issues in the first place.</p>

          <p>Notes Box and Folder List: The Roman numeral in the box number indicates the
                subgroup; the Arabic numerals that follow indicate the series and box number, except
                for boxes in Subgroup II for which the series numbers were omitted. Box numbers with
                three Arabic numerals indicate the series, subseries, and box number. Different
                brands of file folders were used during processing; different colored folders within
                series merely reflect the order in which materials were processed. A check mark
                between the folder title and the dates indicates that there are staples or other
                fasteners in the materials in the folder that were not removed during
                processing.</p>

      <p>The records of UUP included in this collection are complemented by related
                collections held in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and
                Archives at the University at Albany, SUNY. The records of the UUP Oral History
                Project (APAP-099) include interviews with over thirty individuals involved with the
                beginnings of unionization at SUNY and UUP's predecessors, the formation of UUP
                itself, and the first years of UUP's existence. The records of the United University
                Professions (UUP) Albany Chapter (APAP-054) document some of the activities of
                Albany Chapter. The papers of Eugene Link (APAP-025), a professor of history at SUNY
                Plattsburgh and an active member in the early years of UUP and in UUP's
                establishment of membership for retired members, also includes related material. The
                records of WAMC/Northeast Public Radio (APAP-138) include episodes of programs on
                which UUP leaders appeared. For additional labor collections in the Department, see
                the Labor subject guide.</p>
      <p>Over 4,000 images from the records of UUP are available for viewing online from the
                University at Albany Libraries' Digital Collections database. Funding for the
                digitization of these photographs and their description was provided by United
                University Professions.</p>

                            of the minutes in this series document the debate over whether
                            non-teaching professionals should affiliate themselves with SPA or
                            remain autonomous to work for their distinct interests. Some of the SPA

            <p>Minutes of the proceedings of UUP's Executive Board, the body authorized
                            to carry out policies established by the Delegate Assembly and execute
                            written agreements on behalf of UUP. The Board meetings consist of
                            reports by committee chairpersons and officers and the consideration of
                            a variety of resolutions and motions reflecting a concern with a broad
                            range of institutional, social, and political issues. Lists of committee
                            appointments, committee and task force membership lists, and income and
                            expenditure reports for the union are intermittently included. The Board
                            is required to meet at least four times each year, but from the
                            beginning it has met approximately five to ten times annually. See
                            Subgroup IV Office of the Secretary, Series 1 - Executive Board for
                            correspondence and materials distributed at or relating to Executive
                            Board meetings.</p>

            <p>Minutes of the proceedings of the Delegate Assembly, the primary
                            policy-making body of UUP. The minutes reflect the concerns and
                            activities of UUP in the most concise and comprehensive form, because it
                            is in the forum where various chapters from around the state meet to
                            voice local concerns and discuss and vote on policy matters. The
                            Delegate Assembly meets three times during each academic year-Fall,
                            Winter, and Spring.</p>
            <p>The minutes document budget debates (sometimes with itemized budget
                            projections), the election of officers and Executive Board members,
                            amendments to the constitution, and reports from committee chairpersons
                            and officers. The first two years of the minutes include what appear to
                            be verbatim transcripts of the president's report and the reports of
                            various other officers. Afterwards, the reports and the rest of the
                            proceedings are all given in condensed form. In later years, the reports
                            of the officers and committee chairpersons, as well as programs for each
                            Delegate Assembly, were included in packets mailed to delegates prior to
                            the Delegate Assembly and/or distributed to delegates upon their arrival
                            at a Delegate Assembly. See Subgroup IV Secretary, Series 2 - Delegate
                            Assemblies for these and other materials relating to the Delegate
                            Assemblies.</p>

            <p>Verbatim transcripts of the Delegate Assembly proceedings. This series
                            includes only one Delegate Assembly for 1979 and two for 1980, however
                            for the remaining years the transcripts cover all three Delegate
                            Assemblies for each year. Each transcript is divided into two sessions,
                            each covering one day of the Delegate Assembly. Some early transcripts
                            include a list of officers, Executive Board members, committee chairs,
                            and chapter delegates. About half of the transcripts have a table of
                            contents. The transcripts for 1984 include a program for the fall
                            Delegate Assembly. See Subgroup IV Secretary, Series 2 - Delegate
                            Assemblies for the packets containing officer and committee chairperson
                            reports, finiancial information, delegate listings, schedules and
                            programs, and related materials for Delegate Assemblies.</p>

            <p>Correspondence at statewide and chapter levels; meeting minutes, both for
                            statewide and Buffalo chapter; bargaining unit mailings; newsletters;
                            and financial records maintained by Joseph Drew, UUP's first statewide
                            treasurer, who was active both in the statewide SPA and the SPA chapter
                            in Buffalo prior to UUP's creation.</p>
            <p>The records in this series relate mainly to the Senate Professional
                            Association, although some materials are included relating to the State
                            University Federation of Teachers and other contenders for bargaining
                            agent before the creation of UUP. The organization to which the records
                            in each folder primarily relate is indicated in parenthesis in the
                            folder title. The records in this series provide the most information
                            available regarding the financial condition of SPA and UUP at its
                            formation-the state of which was an issue for the union, particularly
                            given its financial reliance at times on NYSTA. (Additional early UUP
                            financial records are located in Series 1 of Subgroup V, Office of the
                            Treasurer.) The records in this series also reflect the differing
                            concerns of professional and academic employees in their selection of a
                            bargaining agent and in negotiations. Also discussed are the cost of the
                            various organizations competing to be bargaining agent in terms of dues
                            versus what they offered their members, and the issue of affiliation
                            with larger organizations such as AFT, NYEA, and NEA and the implication
                            that affiliation with each would have on the bargaining unit. The
                            mailings made by the various contenders for bargaining agent reflect
                            their positions on these and other issues.</p>

            <p>Correspondence and third-party reports make up the bulk of this series,
                            and some of the materials appear to have been reference files rather
                            than related to matters in which SPA/UUP was directly involved. Other
                            materials, such as correspondence and minutes from meetings of the SUNY
                            Board of Trustees, information on the SUNY budget, or about the SUNY
                            Faculty Senate document the environment in which SPA and UUP were
                            created and in which they negotiated contracts. The same can be said for
                            the materials included in the series relating to New York State United
                            Teachers, which was an influential force in UUP's formative years.</p>
            <p>UUP-specific materials include information on contract negotiations, the
                            merger between SPA and SUFT that created UUP, and UUP's general
                            operations. Materials relating to particular articles of the SPA/UUP
                            agreements with the State are included by article number (primarily
                            articles dealing with compensation and evaluation and promotion). Copies
                            of agreements and contracts for collective bargaining in other states,
                            some of which have had sections relating to particular subjects
                            highlighted and/or annotated, are also included along with information
                            regarding collective bargaining in education in other states.
                            Occasionally subject folders contain copies of a SPA newsletter or
                            bulletin that addressed the particular issue. The folders titled
                            "History" contain mainly correspondence and newsletters relating to SPA,
                            SUFT, and other organizations such as NEA that were active during the
                            years preceding the formation of UUP. The folders entitled
                            "Managerial/Confidential" contain materials relating to the initial
                            creation/designation of the bargaining unit that UUP would
                            represent.</p>
            <p>The records in this series were maintained by an original member of the
                            SPA/UUP administrative office staff and reflect activities office-wide.
                            They include the most information available on the issues that SPA/UUP
                            was involved in during its formative years and first five years of UUP's
                            existence, particularly the DeLucia presidential administration
                            (1973-1975). The other records in this Subgroup II and the records in
                            Series 1 of Subgroup V, Office of the Treasurer, complement the records
                            in this series. Series 3 of Subgroup IVA, Special Projects, also
                            contains a small amount of SPA, SUFT, and SUPA related materials.</p>
            <p>The records in this series are some of the many plagued by the
                            inconsistent use of subject titles and filing categories. For example, a
                            general file labeled "committees" contains information relating to
                            various SPA/UUP committees, but some records related to specific
                            committees are located under the subject heading relating to that
                            committee, such as the records relating to the Legislation Committee
                            included in the folders marked "Legislation". Other examples include the
                            closely related materials filed under separate headings such as
                            "librarians" and "SUNY librarians" and "Presidential Speeches" and
                            "Speeches". In order to preserve the original designations given to the
                            various materials during preliminary processing efforts, the original
                            filing categories/folder designations were maintained in these
                            situations. The index for the box and folder list should be consulted to
                            determine the location of related materials on any given subject.</p>

            <p>Correspondence, third-party reports, and conference and meeting materials
                            make up the bulk of this series. Although a prior processing effort
                            identified this series as SPA-SUFT files and the title has been
                            retained, with the exception of two folders in the series specifically
                            related to SUFT, the connection to SUFT of the materials in the other
                            folders is unclear. Many of the materials post-date the merger of SUFT
                            into UUP and numerous pieces of SPA correspondence, board minutes, and
                            other SPA-related materials are also included. This series includes
                            information relating to articles in UUP's negotiated contract related to
                            health science centers and clinical practice concerns, and materials
                            related to NYSUT meetings and activities. Unique to this series are the
                            materials relating to collective bargaining in education in various
                            states. Folders identified by state names contain correspondence between
                            SPA and/or UUP and collective bargaining agents in other states (often
                            other NEA affiliates), requests for information on SPA/UUP's collective
                            bargaining experiences, and newsletters and other publications created
                            by other educational bargaining agents.</p>

            <p>Incomplete sets of newsletters of the State University Federation of
                            Teachers (S.U.F.T. News) and the Senate Professional Association (SPA
                            Bulletin, SPA Spokesman, and For Your Information). The earlier
                            newsletters concentrate on issues regarding negotiations with the state,
                            while in its last year the SPA Spokesman became a more general
                            newsletter covering activities such as improper practice filings and
                            committee work. For Your Information was a newsletter for SPA (and later
                            SUNY/United) leadership and similarly covered a broad variety of
                            subjects, including negotiations, improper practice filings, upcoming
                            Delegate Assemblies, and the election of chapter and statewide
                            leaders.</p>

            <p>Primarily outgoing letters and memoranda, along with occasional reports
                            of the President, minutes of Executive Board meetings, and reports on
                            higher education. The most incoming correspondence is included in the
                            files covering the Drescher and Reilly administrations (1984-1993).
                            Infrequently an outgoing letter includes a notation that the incoming
                            letter being responded to is filed under the correspondent's name in the
                            alphabetical files. These files are included in Subgroup IV, Office of
                            the Secretary, Series 5.</p>
            <p>This series covers part of the Drescher administration, all of the Reilly
                            administration, and part of the Scheuerman administration (with future
                            additions anticipated for the Scheuerman years). There are no official
                            chronological files available for the DeLucia or Wakshull
                            administrations, although two folders containing chronological
                            correspondence for the last year of Lawrence DeLucia's administration
                            were found in the working files of one of UUP's first Executive
                            Directors and included in this series.</p>
            <p>The primary author is UUP's President. Correspondents include UUP's
                            Executive Board, statewide officers, chapter presidents, committee
                            chairpersons and committee members, individual members of UUP, AFT and
                            NYSUT representatives, the trustees of SUNY, the governor and
                            legislators of New York State, the Governor's Office of Employee
                            Relations, and representatives of other labor unions. Topics covered in
                            this series include interactions with the State University and State/UUP
                            Joint Labor/Management Committees; grievances including the allocation
                            of legal defense funds; chapter relations including correspondence with
                            chapter presidents as a group and individually regarding specific campus
                            concerns or invitations to attend chapter events; committee
                            appointments; responses to members who have voiced a complaint or
                            opinion on UUP and its activities; thank you letters to members for
                            forwarded copies of articles and books and for their participation in
                            activities such as lobbying days and phone banks; congratulatory letters
                            to elected officers, appointed committee members, and winners of honors
                            from SUNY or within their profession; letters to newspaper editors on
                            SUNY budget issues; and letters expressing solidarity (and sometimes
                            monetary support) to other labor groups in their relations with
                            management. Other topics include negotiations, election endorsements,
                            retirement benefits concerns, and correspondence with AFT and NYSUT. The
                            SUNY budget and retrenchment are recurring topics particularly in the
                            Scheuerman files. Personnel matters for the UUP executive office and
                            inquiries and complaints on member benefits are also occasionally dealt
                            with. There is a small amount of correspondence relating to President
                            Reilly's position as a Professor of English at SUNY Albany and his
                            specific research interest in African-American authors included in his
                            chronological files.</p>
            <p>The materials are in reverse chronological order by either date sent or
                            received. There is some overlap between the chronological files during
                            the change over of presidential administrations, as well as between some
                            files particularly in the 1988-90 period. Indexes to the correspondence
                            were part of the Drescher and Reilly files, and appear to be in the
                            order materials were added to the file, rather than chronological order.
                            The indexes provides the date, sender and recipient (both often
                            identified by initials only) and a brief description of the subject
                            matter. There is no index for September 3, 1991 to January 31, 1992, and
                            from February 1993 on.</p>

            <p>E-mail messages broadcast to chapters, chapters presidents, executive
                            board members, and labor relations specialists keeping them informed
                            about UUP position on and/or handling of various issues such as the SUNY
                            budget, negotiations, activities of the SUNY Board of Trustees, and
                            legislative developments. Messages also discuss chapter election results
                            and upcoming meetings and workshops (both substantive and logistical
                            aspects); forward AFT updates; and provide summaries of press reports of
                            interest ("UUPdate") and information regarding upcoming Delegate
                            Assemblies.</p>
            <p>UUP's President Tim Reilly was the primary sender of these messages,
                            although the series also includes messages broadcast by other officers,
                            committee chairpersons (primarily Janet Potter, chairperson of the
                            Legislation Committee), and by various chapter representatives. Although
                            primarily consisting of group messages, this series also includes some
                            individual messages that deal with specific issues of concern to just
                            one individual or chapter. For the most part, both the sender and
                            recipient group(s) are clearly identified on the messages, however, for
                            some of the messages recipient information is not included and the
                            sender is sometimes only identified by his or her e-mail address
                            (consisting only of the sender's initials) rather than a full name.</p>

            <p>The bulk of the records in this series were created during the presidency
                            of Samuel Wakshull (May 1975-May 1981) and were either originally or
                            during a previous processing effort divided into two subseries, Subject
                            Files and Administrative Files. For the most part there is no overlap in
                            the subjects covered by the records in these two subseries. While
                            misfiles were frequently discovered and corrected during processing; no
                            systematic effort was made to locate and correct all misfiles.
                            Additional subject files covering some of the years of the Wakshull's
                            administration are located in Series 2 and 3 of Subgroup II, UUP
                            Predecessors and Early UUP Years, and Series 6 of Subgroup IV Office of

              <p>Primarily correspondence from UUP's President relating to various
                                subjects and issues of concern to UUP members, and with SUNY
                                management and SUNY's Chancellor. Included much less frequently are
                                articles, third-party reports and publications, brochures, court and
                                arbitrator decisions, financial statements, and other materials
                                supplementing the topics being addressed in the correspondence. This
                                subseries includes a substantial amount of information regarding the
                                challenge to UUP's position as collective bargaining agent on the
                                SUNY campuses by the NEA/NYEA in the mid-1970s, as well as on the
                                American Association of University Professors (AAUP) which was also
                                an active challenger to UUP during the NEA/NYEA challenge period. In
                                addition, this subseries contains correspondence relating to the
                                first few years that the agency fee law was in place.</p>
              <p>Correspondence is often filed under the name of the individual to
                                whom it was addressed, including various individuals working at SUNY
                                Central Administration, at the Chancellor's office, and at the
                                Governor's Office of Employee Relations. However, correspondence
                                from these representatives, as well as those of NYSUT, are also
                                found in the relevant subject files. In addition, materials related
                                to NYSUT committees, projects, and personnel are filed under the
                                general NYSUT headings or under project, individual, or committee
                                names. Materials related to committees are often filed under the
                                "Committees" heading as well as under the subject name itself (such
                                as "Grievances"). The files in this subseries were initially
                                identified during an earlier processing effort. During the course of
                                processing the rest of the collection, additional files were found
                                dealing solely with the Wakshull years and were incorporated into
                                this subseries. They are identified by an * in front of the folder
                                title.</p>

              <p>Incoming and outgoing correspondence from UUP's President, Executive
                                Director, and other UUP personnel; as well as internal
                                correspondence between the President, Executive Director, membership
                                coordinator, and NYSUT legal counsel. Materials were filed by
                                chapter involved, under individual name (relating to grievance
                                matters, and also for UUP personnel matters), and occasionally by
                                subject. Topics covered include retrenchments on campuses;
                                appointments to and resignations from committees; campus specific
                                concerns; grievances; questions from members regarding benefits and
                                membership; resolutions sent in by chapters; minutes for chapter
                                board meetings as well as chapter labor/management meetings; and
                                information on chapter officers. The amount and type of information
                                available for each chapter varies widely. Additional records on
                                individual chapters make up Subseries 3.3 in Subgroup IV, Office of
                                the Secretary. Agency fee issues and the separation of UUP from NEA
                                are infrequent topics of discussion. The records for the Grievance
                                Committee in this series include reports to the President presenting
                                the committee's position on/view of the grievances under its
                                consideration. These reports provide some of the most detailed
                                information available regarding the issues that UUP has sought to
                                remedy through grievances on behalf of its bargaining unit
                                members.</p>
              <p>One recurring concern reflected in the President's correspondence
                                with chapter leaders is the reasons behind the resignation of UUP
                                members, particularly as UUP was seeking during this period to shore
                                up its membership not only to defeat the NEA/NYEA and other
                                challengers, but to provide the strongest front possible for future
                                contract negotiations. Although the bulk of the materials in this
                                series cover the Wakshull administration (1975-1981), this series
                                also includes some documents from the DeLucia administration
                                (1973-1975).</p>

            <p>Primarily subject files containing incoming and outgoing correspondence,
                            third-party reports, SUNY correspondence and SUNY-produced materials,
                            materials distributed by various higher education organizations, copies
                            of legislation, SUNY budgets, and other materials relating to each
                            topic. The primary correspondent is UUP President Nuala Drescher, and
                            for the files that date back to the prior administration, UUP President
                            Samuel Wakshull and his Director of Staff Evelyn Hartman. Correspondence
                            recipients include chapter leadership; Executive Board members;
                            individual UUP members; the governor of New York State and state
                            legislators; and staff members of NYSUT, particularly its higher
                            education lobbyist, legal counsel, and president, informing them about
                            UUP's position on an issue or seeking NYSUT input regarding a
                            matter.</p>
            <p>Some testimony given by President Drescher on various subjects is also
                            included. The activities of SUNY are documented by correspondence sent
                            from SUNY directly to UUP, as well as correspondence distributed by SUNY
                            Central Administration to campus presidents or that the management of a
                            particular campus distributed to campus groups such as department heads
                            and deans, as is the case in the "Discretionary Monies" folder. There is
                            some administrative correspondence with GOER setting up meetings and
                            informing them of upcoming meetings involving UUP leadership.</p>
            <p>A broad range of topics are covered in this series, with UUP's
                            legislative activities and yearly concerns regarding the SUNY budget
                            most heavily documented. The legislative-related folders include
                            correspondence with NYSUT's higher education lobbyist, press releases,
                            news articles, copies of testimony, copies of legislation,
                            correspondence to chapter presidents regarding status of bills of
                            interest, and correspondence with legislators. The SUNY budget materials
                            include copies of budgets, information distributed by SUNY Central
                            Administration for campuses regarding the annual fiscal plan; UUP
                            analyses of budgets; and UUP mailings to chapter leadership regarding
                            the budget. The amount of information available about each topic, as
                            well as the directness of its connection with UUP, vary widely. For
                            example, while the "Day Care-Campus Reports" folders include the
                            responses made by chapters to a request from UUP for information about
                            their involvement with campus day care centers, the folders for the
                            Empire State Day Care Services Corporation mainly contain minutes and
                            reports for board meetings prepared by that organization and dealing
                            solely with that organization and sent to UUP's President as a member of
                            the board of directors.</p>
            <p>This series is an artificial gathering of subject files that primarily
                            cover Drescher's years in office (1981-1987), but that were otherwise
                            not identified by who kept them or in what capacity. It includes a small
                            group of files that appear to have been maintained for just the
                            1982-1983 academic year. As Drescher's chronological file was not begun
                            until August 1984, these earlier files provide a source for Drescher's
                            outgoing correspondence during early time periods. Correspondence filed
                            after Drescher's chronological file was begun appears to have been filed
                            both chronologically and by subject. The subject files in series 7 of
                            Subgroup IV, Office of the Secretary, provide additional subject files
                            covering the years President Drescher was in office.</p>

            <p>Correspondence, reports, meeting agendas and minutes, and other
                            distributed materials regarding various UUP committees that the
                            president was a member of, or kept informed of the activities of;
                            correspondence, reports, and materials distributed regarding projects
                            (one-time and continuing) that UUP was involved in (such as the
                            committees of UUP's AFT and NYSUT affiliates that UUP was represented
                            on, conferences that UUP's president attended, and testimony given by
                            UUP's president before various State Senate and Assembly committees);
                            and correspondence, reports, and reference materials on topics in which
                            UUP had a continuing interest (such as the proportion of the annual New
                            York State budget allocated to SUNY, retirement benefits for SUNY
                            employees, proposed legislation affecting SUNY and UUP's lobbying
                            efforts, and the Public Employees Benefit Fund which provided benefits
                            to members of UUP, NYSUT, and PEF [the Public Employees Federation]).
                            There are numerous handwritten notes made by the president on various
                            documents included in this series. Some of those notations, along with
                            notes of his secretary, are purely administrative, i.e., confirming his
                            attendance at a conference or meeting. However, some are more
                            substantive, such as his notes from a particular meeting, his questions
                            or thoughts noted on a report, his handwritten inquires to others
                            involved in a project asking for elaboration on a particular issue or
                            point, notes on meeting agendas regarding the actions taken, and draft
                            correspondence.</p>
            <p>Reilly's files for Delegate Assemblies and Executive Board meetings to
                            varying degrees duplicate the materials in the separate Delegate
                            Assemblies and Executive Board series in Subgroup IV, Office of the
                            Secretary. These records also frequently include Reilly's handwritten
                            notes on the distributed agenda and other distributed materials, as well
                            as correspondence received by Reilly and not included in the Secretary's
                            files for these meetings. Files do not exist in this series for all the
                            Delegate Assemblies and Executive Board meetings held during Reilly's
                            administration. Occasionally materials are included in meeting files
                            that seem to merely reflect that they were received at the time of the
                            meeting, not that the subject of the correspondence specifically related
                            to the meeting. Similarly, the materials retained from the NYSUT and AFT
                            executive bodies meetings that Reilly attended are only those that had
                            his handwritten notes or that dealt specifically with UUP.</p>
            <p>Particularly heavily documented subjects include the annual SUNY and New
                            York State budget, particularly the 1988-1989 budget; problems with the
                            funding of state employee retirement plans, including the TIAA-CREF
                            option in the late 1980s; UUP's involvement with its affiliates AFT and
                            NYSUT and the functioning of the Public Employees Division of the New
                            York State AFL-CIO; extensive correspondence between Reilly and
                            committee chairpersons regarding recommended members for their
                            committees and with current and prospective committee members regarding
                            their interest in serving on the committee; UUP's legislative and
                            lobbying activities; a myriad of topics relating to SUNY besides its
                            budget such as the proposed restructuring of the SUNY hospitals. This
                            series also includes materials related to some administrative UUP
                            activities, such as life insurance offered to its members, and files
                            devoted to various officers or departments in UUP's administrative
                            office and their activities on behalf of UUP and those it
                            represents.</p>
            <p>This series is a somewhat artificial gathering, the bulk of which is made
                            up of records that appear to have been maintained by Reilly's secretary.
                            As a result, at times the files include his secretary's notes on setting
                            up meetings or who will or will not attend a particular meeting or
                            conference. There are also notes from Reilly to his secretary
                            instructing her as to the handling of the document in question, such as
                            where it should be filed or who it should be distributed to. In
                            addition, some records more appropriately maintained by UUP's Secretary
                            somehow ended up with the records included in this series rather than
                            the subject or other files maintained by the Secretary. For example, the
                            only location for information regarding UUP's Humane Animal
                            Experimentation Task Force is in this series, not in the committee, task
                            force, and working group records included in Series 4 of Subgroup IV,
                            Office of the Secretary. This series is also limited in that there is
                            irregular coverage of repeating events. For example, a "committee
                            activity register" reporting the dates of meetings and tasks
                            accomplished of each of UUP's committees, only exists for the 1988-1989
                            year. Similarly, there are abrupt ends to topics that theoretically
                            should continue through the end of Reilly's term, such as the records
                            filed under "Vice President for Professionals" that end in April 1990,
                            rather than continuing to the end of Reilly's tenure as President.
                            Still, regardless of their organization or origin, the records in this
                            series provide probably the best sense for the wide variety of issues
                            UUP and its president address at any one time as well as the
                            administrative functioning of UUP and its administrative office, and the
                            views and opinions of President Reilly. In many instances, the files in
                            this series were continued into the Scheuerman administration. It is
                            anticipated that those materials will become part of a new
                            "Projects/Subjects--William E. Scheuerman" series in the future.</p>

            <p>The 1982-1985 contract between the state and UUP provided for a study of
                            the promotional opportunities for professional employees of the State
                            University of New York. After the commissioned study was issued by
                            consulting firm Arthur Young in May 1986, steps were taken to implement
                            its recommendations. A Management Advisory Committee on Classification
                            and Compensation (MACCC) was established by the State University and
                            given the responsibility of adopting a structure of professional titles
                            that would provide promotional opportunities for professional employees.
                            UUP participated in a joint labor/management committee of the same name
                            formed to provide input to the larger SUNY MACCC (which was made up of
                            just SUNY representatives). The joint labor/management MACCC acted in an
                            advisory capacity only.</p>
            <p>This series includes correspondence between SUNY and its campuses,
                            between SUNY and UUP, and primarily between UUP and its professional
                            members and its chapter vice presidents for professionals, chapter
                            presidents, and others, keeping them informed of the status of the
                            reclassification project. Also included is correspondence from chapters
                            reporting on reclassification activities on campuses, including their
                            implementation of the "Albany Plan"-a system implemented by the
                            administration of the SUNY Albany campus for the internal promotion of
                            professional employees which other campuses were required to adopt and
                            adapt for their own professionals; correspondence appealing denials of
                            reclassification for specific titles sent to UUP's Vice President for
                            Professionals; correspondence supporting the creation of titles within
                            specific job families; the Arthur Young study; and listings of titles
                            designated for reclassification. The primary correspondent is Thomas
                            Corigliano who was Vice President for Professionals at the time. Other
                            correspondents include SUNY representatives, UUP President Tim Reilly,
                            UUP Director of Staff Samuel Livingston, the Assistant Director of Staff
                            and various field representatives, and UUP's chapter leadership.</p>

                            activities of the Safety and Health Specialist included conducting
                            campus visits, reporting potential safety and health problems, and
                            making recommendations on addressing them to UUP chapter leadership;
                            responding to requests from chapter leadership to address specific
                            safety and health concerns on individual campuses; conducting training
                            for campus representatives on safety and health issues; attending health
                            and safety committee meetings on behalf of UUP; attending professional
                            seminars and conferences; and reviewing and interpreting reports dealing
                            with safety and health matters received by UUP and its chapters.</p>
            <p>This series consists of records kept by the Vice Presidents for
                            Professionals, primarily copies of correspondence of the Safety and
                            Health Specialist, Rodney Whalen, to chapter leaders reporting results
                            of campus safety visits and responding to requests for assistance, and
                            reports made by the Safety and Health Specialist to the Vice President
                            for Professionals (first Thomas Corigliano, then Thomas Matthews),
                            regarding his activities on behalf of UUP. Also included in this series
                            is a group of booklets/handbooks prepared by the Safety and Health
                            Specialist on health and safety issues, materials addressing specific
                            safety and health topics, and a limited amount of material regarding the
                            joint labor/management committee on AIDS. For additional materials
                            relating to UUP's Safety and Health Specialist and UUP's concern with

            <p>Correspondence arranging meetings of the Executive Board and sending out
                            materials to be considered by the Board such as agendas; proposed
                            resolutions (both for UUP Delegate Assemblies and for NYSUT
                            Representative Assemblies); officer reports and testimony; third- party
                            reports on higher education, the budgets for New York State and SUNY,
                            and other topics of concern. Minutes of past Executive Board meetings
                            were also routinely distributed. This series also contains
                            correspondence enacting decisions by the Board and correspondence
                            acknowledging receipt of materials for consideration by the Board. Some
                            of the correspondence is actually addressed to chapter presidents and/or
                            other leadership groups, but the Executive Board was copied (although in
                            some instances this is not clearly indicated).</p>
            <p>The minutes for Executive Board meetings held from May 1973 to May 1993
                            are included in Subgroup I, Governing Bodies, Series 2. Additional
                            materials regarding Executive Board meetings are located in Series 3 and
                            5 of Subgroup III, Office of the President, subseries 6.1 of this
                            Subgroup, and Series 1 of Subgroup V, Office of the Treasurer.</p>
            <p>Several separate groupings of records, in various organizational states,
                            were combined to create this series. Files from 1985 on were filed in
                            separate categories: "correspondence" and "minutes and agendas" (the
                            latter of which also included numerous attachments and materials
                            distributed at or prior to Board meetings). Some earlier files were
                            similarly categorized, but with a great deal of overlapping and
                            misfiling between them. For ease of use they were combined into a single
                            chronological group. Materials in the files were put into chronological
                            order unless the dates were so widely divergent that it appeared they
                            may have been a set of materials distributed at a single time, in which
                            case the materials were left together. This is particularly true for the
                            minutes and agenda files from 1988 on, which were rubberbanded together
                            with the memorandum used to send materials to board members. These
                            groupings are now separated by blank sheets of paper. For the most part,
                            the dates on the folders represents the dates of the memoranda
                            distributing the meeting agendas (sent out a few weeks before each
                            meeting); although the attached materials often pre- and post-date the
                            memorandum. Beginning with the files for Executive Board meetings held
                            in 1994, just the date of the meeting is given on the folder. There is
                            some duplication between materials distributed to the Executive Board
                            and those distributed at Delegate Assemblies, such as officer
                            reports.</p>

                            correspondence, UUP-created reports, and other materials distributed to
                            delegates regarding issues under consideration. Attendance and rooming
                            forms on which chapters reported the names of their delegates and their
                            elected term are also included for some of the DAs prior to 1986.</p>
            <p>Minutes and transcripts for Delegate Assemblies are included in Subgroup
                            I, Governing Bodies, Series 3 and Series 4, and include minutes for
                            years not covered by the materials in this series (1973-1976). Some
                            additional materials relating to DAs held between 1973 and 1976 are
                            included in Subgroup II, UUP Predecessors and Early UUP Years, Series 2,
                            and in Subseries 6.1 of this Subgroup for the years 1973-1981. Materials
                            from some of the Delegate Assemblies held during President Reilly's term
                            in office are included in Series 5 of Subgroup III.</p>
            <p>Files were in no standard order originally and an attempt was made during
                            processing to generally arrange them in the following order: program,
                            agendas, officer and committee chairperson reports, resolutions,
                            correspondence and "other" materials. However, no attempt was made to
                            group materials such as officer and chairperson reports with the
                            memoranda that purported to send them to delegates if they were not
                            found attached to the memorandum to begin with. Expense vouchers (a
                            three-part carbon form included in every DA packet) were not retained.
                            The actual packets mailed to delegates prior to each DA and the packets
                            distributed to delegates at the DA were included in some later files,
                            particularly from the Fall 1993 DA on, often with a listing of the
                            materials that were included in each packet. The general DA files for
                            this time period include early mailings made with rooming forms and
                            delegate apportionment information, copies of resolutions used at the
                            DA, the secretary's notes from the DA sent to the stenographer for use
                            in preparing the transcript for the DA, and miscellaneous materials
                            distributed at the DA or relating to the DA, including election related
                            materials from the Spring DAs.</p>

              <p>Letters, memoranda, and other mailings made to chapter presidents
                                from UUP's Administrative Office primarily from statewide officers
                                and committee chairpersons, along with copies of reports, testimony,
                                benefits information, and other materials distributed to chapter
                                presidents for further dissemination among chapter members. Topics
                                include SUNY and chapter budgets including testimony of UUP's
                                President on SUNY budget; statements by New York State's governor
                                and legislators on higher education; UUP's lobbying activities;
                                benefits available from NYSUT and UUP for active and retired
                                members; voter registration and election endorsements; summaries of
                                Executive Board meetings; status reports on negotiations and
                                contract ratification; solidarity campaigns; new member recruitment
                                activities; agency fee procedures; chapter presidents' meetings;
                                upcoming Delegate Assemblies; information regarding chapter
                                secretaries and the CWA contracts covering chapter secretaries.</p>
              <p>Some materials in this series are not specifically identified as
                                being sent to chapter presidents (i.e., there is no accompanying
                                cover memorandum), however because regular mailings are made to
                                chapter presidents, this does not preclude that such materials were
                                not also distributed to this group. In other instances, attachments
                                referred to in some mailings were not included with the records in
                                this series. The amount of correspondence in these files drops off
                                substantially after May 1993. From approximately 1990 on, a
                                significant portion of the information disseminated to chapter
                                presidents was sent via electronic mail. See Subgroup III, Office of
                                the President, Series 2 for electronic mail correspondence.</p>

              <p>Correspondence between chapter representatives and statewide officers
                                and Administrative Office, and inter-chapter correspondence that was
                                copied to UUP's Administrative Office, including memoranda and other
                                materials distributed by campus administration on policies and other
                                issues that chapter officers wanted to make statewide officers aware
                                of. Topics include status of grievances; chapter meetings; chapter
                                elections (including disputed elections); individual campus issues
                                such as the proposed sale of a building used for campus or policies
                                particularly impacting one campus; statewide issues such as SUNY
                                policies and operations as a whole; negotiations commentary and
                                committees; correspondence to campus presidents; and news articles
                                sent to UUP's President on chapter informational picketing and
                                higher education issues. Files for the health science centers
                                (particularly for Brooklyn Health Science Center [formerly the
                                Downstate Medical Center]) also contain correspondence regarding
                                clinical practice management plans, and draft agreements. Chapter
                                newsletters are also included in this series, although most are not
                                complete runs. They are in separate folders for the mid 1970s to the
                                late 1980s, after which time newsletters were included in the main
                                chapter folders. Chapter newsletters inform members about upcoming
                                meetings, the status of negotiations, messages from the chapter
                                president, information on grievances affecting the chapter, and SUNY
                                budget issues.</p>
              <p>Chapter records precede the formation of UUP and include materials
                                from the predecessor SPA chapter as well as occasional SUFT
                                materials, including occasional newsletters. Early chapter files
                                also include correspondence regarding members concerns' over the
                                proposed merger of SPA and SUFT, early attempts to increase
                                membership, frequent reports certifying elected officers for
                                purposes of representation at the Delegate Assemblies, and copies of
                                the chapter's constitutions and by-laws. The records from 1975 to
                                1977 contain many letters on administrative grievance matters, as
                                well as election report forms and correspondence regarding members'
                                resignations and chapter newsletters. The chapter files deal with
                                the NEA/NYEA challenge to UUP in 1977-1978 to varying degrees. Other
                                one time issues covered in this series include a 1974 survey of
                                chapter activities, and correspondence in 1986 and 1987 regarding
                                discretionary salary increases. The bulk of the files for the years
                                1989 to 1991 are made up of rosters of members receiving increases
                                in salary and additional correspondence regarding discretionary
                                salary adjustments, as well as chapter election reports. Election
                                reports and "Article 16.4" information (by which the campuses are
                                required to inform UUP of new employees) are frequent in the files
                                covering 1991 to 1994. Correspondence between UUP's President and
                                chapter leaders and members about campus-specific issues such as
                                parking, teaching workloads, and grievances from CWA regarding
                                chapter secretaries, as well as grievances filed by chapter members
                                are common in the records from the 1990s.</p>
              <p>Chapter files were maintained in several groupings, often with
                                overlapping dates. In the course of processing, these files were
                                organized into chronological order and duplicates eliminated. The
                                files are currently arranged alphabetically in two chronological
                                groupings, 1968-May 1993 and June 1993-1996. Misfiles were
                                frequently found and corrected during processing, although no
                                systematic review was made to ensure that all misfiles were found
                                and corrected. The most common misfiles were between similarly named
                                chapters, such as Stony Brook and Stony Brook Health Science Center,
                                the three Buffalo-area chapters, and the various health science
                                centers.</p>
              <p>There are occasional gaps, or extremely sparse coverage, in the
                                records relating to various chapters, particularly prior to 1980 and
                                for the early 1990s. Additional chapter files (mainly covering 1975
                                to 1981) are located in Subseries 3.2 of Subgroup III, Office of the
                                President. In addition, for the records in this series, particularly
                                for the period of the late 1970s and 1980s, the amount of
                                correspondence existing for a chapter seems to be directly related
                                to the degree of activism and involvement of the chapter president
                                in UUP at the statewide level. During a preliminary processing
                                effort undated materials were included at the very back of the
                                earliest file. However, these materials may or may not predate the
                                other materials in the folder. Infrequently correspondence in this
                                subseries includes a notation that the incoming letter being
                                responded to is filed under the correspondent's name in the
                                alphabetical files. These files are included in Subgroup IV, Office
                                of the Secretary, Series 5. Finally, it should be noted that
                                although UUP's Administrative Office maintains files on individual
                                chapters, they do not necessarily present a complete record of the
                                activities of any given chapter, nor do they represent all of the
                                records of a chapter. Individual chapter offices may have more
                                extensive records relating to their chapter's past activities.</p>

            <p>The records in this series document, to varying degrees, the activities
                            of UUP's standing committees, ad hoc committees, joint labor-management
                            committees, task forces, and working groups. Included for most
                            committees are the administrative correspondence created at UUP's
                            administrative office setting up meetings, obtaining approval from the
                            Governor's Office of Employee Relations for organizational leave time
                            for meeting attendees, and confirming committee appointments. Lists of
                            committee members are also frequently included.</p>
            <p>The substantive work of each committee is documented by meeting agendas
                            and minutes; the materials, such as third-party reports, distributed to
                            committee members for their use in preparing for committee meetings;
                            correspondence between UUP's President and the committee chairperson;
                            and correspondence from UUP's officers and the committee chairperson to
                            the committee as a whole. The records for joint labor-management
                            committees include reports and correspondence prepared by the state with
                            regard to the committee, as well as communications between only UUP's
                            participants on those committees. If a formal report was at some point
                            prepared by a committee or task force, drafts of the report are often
                            included in that committee's or task force's records. Finally, the
                            reports made by the committee chairperson to Delegate Assemblies are
                            occasionally included in this series. (Committee chairperson reports are
                            also found in the Delegate Assembly records in Series 2 of this
                            Subgroup.)</p>
            <p>As of February 2001, UUP's standing committees are: Retired Membership,
                            Affirmative Action, Elections and Credentials, Finance, Grievance,
                            Legislation, Membership, Negotiations, Part-Time Concerns, Solidarity,
                            and Women's Rights and Concerns. Over the years, UUP's ad hoc
                            committees, task forces, and working groups have addressed a variety of
                            issues, particularly in the area of higher education and improving SUNY
                            (for example, the Student Retention and Recruitment Committee, the
                            Public Education Committee, the Undergraduate Education Task Force, the
                            Teacher Education Task Force, the University Development Committee, and
                            the Excellence Committee). Issues of concern to particular segments of
                            UUP's bargaining unit have also been addressed (for example, the
                            Colleges of Technology Task Force, the Health Science Center Concerns
                            Committee, and the Nursing Profession Work Group). Joint
                            labor-management committees have addressed safety and health issues,
                            child care, health benefits, professional study leaves, employee
                            assistance programs, salary disparities, and providing retraining and
                            re-education opportunities for retrenched employees. Finally, some of
                            UUP's committees have focused on improving UUP and its operations such
                            as the Constitutional Study Committee, the Computer Technology
                            Committee, and the Re-Imagine UUP Committee.</p>
            <p>Committee-specific materials include election result reports and
                            correspondence on possible election irregularities for the Elections and
                            Credentials Committee; financial summaries and the report of the
                            treasurer, and chapter budget requests and approval requests for
                            extraordinary expenditures for the Finance Committee; chapter responses
                            to a survey on membership and membership recruitment activities in 1982
                            for the Membership Committee; proposed legislation and state budgets for
                            the Legislation Committee; and studies on indoor air pollution and other
                            workplace health concerns for the Safety and Health Committee. There is
                            some overlap between the records of the Membership Committee and Retired
                            Membership Committee because correspondence were occasionally addressed
                            to both groups, and they deal with an overlapping area of interest. The
                            files for the Negotiations Committee has correspondence, appointment
                            letters, and meeting information for UUP's Negotiations Team and its Ad
                            Hoc Advisory Committee for Negotiations, occasional negotiations
                            bulletins and responses to members on issues of concern for
                            negotiations, and multiple copies of lists of committee and team members
                            as well as some attendance lists for negotiations meetings and
                            workshops. Grievance committee records include reports to the president
                            recommending the continued pursuit or the abandonment of specific
                            grievances. Background materials for some of the applications submitted
                            to the Legal Defense Fund Committee are included with the records of
                            that committee.</p>
            <p>The amount of materials available for each committee, task force, and
                            working group, and the degree of organization of those materials,
                            varies. The records that make up this series were primarily taken from
                            the main committee records maintained by UUP's statewide secretary.
                            Frequently, however, additional folders for specific committees were
                            encountered during processing and incorporated into this series. Except
                            in a few instances when the additional materials were retained
                            separately because the identity of the individual maintaining the
                            records was known, the new materials were interfiled in chronological
                            order into the main committee files, which were themselves organized, to
                            the extent possible, into chronological order during processing. The
                            records for the Legislation Committee during the 1980s were in
                            particular disarray and it was only possible to put them in rough
                            chronological order. Throughout this series, undated materials were kept
                            near their original location but due to the sometimes widely varying
                            dates of the documents found on either side of undated documents, some
                            undated materials may not be correctly located by date. The names of a
                            few committees and task forces have changed over the years, however for
                            the most part just one name is used for each committee in the folder
                            list for this series.</p>
            <p>Materials related to committee work during the mid-1970s can also be
                            found in the SPA/UUP Administrative Office General Files in Series 2 of
                            Subgroup II, usually under the name of the topic that each committee
                            dealt with rather than the committee name itself (i.e., Legislation or
                            Membership rather than Legislation Committee or Membership Committee).
                            Committee files for 1975-1981 are also located in Subgroup III,
                            Subseries 3.1, Wakshull Administration, Subject Files. Finally, the
                            project and subject files in Series 5 of Subgroup III include materials
                            relating to the work of some committees, task forces, and working groups
                            during the Reilly presidency from May 1987 to May 1993.</p>

            <p>Outgoing correspondence from members of UUP's Administrative Office,
                            including the President, Executive Director (later Director of Staff),
                            Secretary, communications associates, field representatives, benefits
                            specialists, and office manager. Recipients include individual members
                            of UUP, chapter officers, NYSUT representatives, SUNY administrators on
                            individual campuses and statewide, representatives of the Governor's
                            Office of Employee Relations, legislators, editors of New York
                            newspapers, and representatives of various unions and other
                            organizations that UUP had contact with in conducting its business.
                            Incoming correspondence are occasionally attached, more so during the
                            Drescher administration (1981-1987) than during the Wakshull
                            administration (1975-1981), but enclosures referred to in outgoing
                            letters are rarely included. Topics include appointments to committees;
                            questions regarding the reasons for members' resignations;
                            communications regarding chapter-specific issues; inquiries about
                            benefits provided to members, which during the 1970s was primarily life
                            insurance; later correspondence from benefits specialists covering a
                            wider variety of benefit issues; and grievances. For the most part
                            grievance-related correspondence are administrative (i.e., to set up
                            hearings with the State and the grievant, to inform the grievants of the
                            status of their grievance including decisions by UUP not to appeal a
                            grievance, and to inform the State that a grievance decision will or
                            will not be appealed).</p>
            <p>Additional topics include requests for leave time for committee
                            participation; negotiations; contact with the AFT and NYSUT; Delegate
                            Assemblies; correspondence with State and SUNY representatives; and
                            correspondence with members and UUP leadership on one-time issues.
                            Occasionally a copy of a chapter newsletter is included with a member's
                            correspondence inquiring about or commenting on something that they read
                            in the newsletter. Infrequently the outgoing correspondence in Subgroup
                            III, Office of the President, Series 1--Chronological Files, and
                            Subgroup IV, Office of the Secretary, Subseries 3.3-Chapter Files
                            includes a notation that the incoming letter being responded to is filed
                            under the correspondent's name in these alphabetical files.</p>
            <p>The files begin in May 1975, when Samuel Wakshull became UUP's President
                            and end in 1996 during the Scheuerman administration, and are arranged
                            alphabetically in two chronological groupings, May 1975-May 1993 and
                            June 1993-June 1996. Materials were filed alphabetically under the name
                            of the recipient except in cases when the recipient worked for an
                            organization, such as NYSUT, in which case the correspondence was filed
                            either under the recipient's name or the organization's, or under both
                            names. The vast majority of letters sent to SUNY/GOER representatives
                            about particular grievances are filed under the name of the grievant,
                            not the recipient of the letter. Although correspondence continued to be
                            filed alphabetically through 1996 (when this series was discontinued by
                            UUP's Administrative Office), the regularity of the correspondence in
                            this series drops off significantly towards the end of 1990 and early
                            1991. Correspondence dated after that time were more often from the
                            Director of Staff and the office project coordinator than the President,
                            and primarily dealt with individual grievances.</p>

                            additionally designated as belonging to Edward J. Alfonsin (UUP's
                            Secretary from 1975 to 1981, although some of the files pre-date his
                            tenure as Secretary). It is unknown if this arrangement was original to
                            the records themselves or created during preliminary processing. The
                            records in this series overlap the records in other series in this
                            collection, particularly the records of Delegate Assemblies and
                            Executive Board meetings. However, the membership lists in this series
                            are not found elsewhere in the collection.</p>

              <p>This series includes Delegate Assembly and Executive Board records,
                                and subject files. The Delegate Assembly records include programs,
                                minutes, correspondence and other documents relating to proposed
                                resolutions and actions taken at Delegate Assemblies, membership
                                reports used to determine the number of delegates allocated to each
                                chapter, and reports from chapters indicating their elected
                                delegates. Also occasionally included with the Delegate Assembly
                                materials are lists of the academic and professional members at each
                                chapter. Materials related to the Executive Board mainly include
                                correspondence sent to the Board with information on upcoming
                                meetings, letters of resignation, and meeting minutes. Additional
                                materials are organized by subject matter, primarily relating to the
                                Research Foundation of the State University of New York and whether
                                Research Foundation employees (who are not part of the UUP
                                bargaining unit) were being used in place of retrenched members of
                                the bargaining unit.</p>

            <p>Subject files designated as those of the Secretary, although the exact
                            individual maintaining the files is unknown as they span several
                            Secretaries' terms and include materials from prior to UUP's creation
                            through the Reilly administration. The bulk of the files cover the end
                            of the Wakshull administration, the entire Drescher administration, and
                            the first year or so of the Reilly administration. It is suspected that
                            the project and subject files from the Reilly administration included in
                            Series 5 of Subgroup III in some way superseded these files except with
                            regard to a few subjects.</p>
            <p>This series primarily includes correspondence, UUP-produced materials,
                            and third-party reports and publications. Correspondents include UUP's
                            President, Secretary, Vice Presidents, and occasionally UUP's Director
                            of Staff. The recipients include chapter leadership, individual members,
                            representatives of other higher education and labor organizations. Among
                            the materials that date back to the Wakshull administration, some
                            infrequently include handwritten notes that may be those of Evelyn
                            Hartman, UUP's Executive Director during the Wakshull administration. To
                            some extent, the materials in this series are slightly more
                            administrative to UUP's operations than those included in the project
                            and subject files of Presidents Wakshull, Drescher, and Reilly in series
                            3, 4, and 5 of Subgroup III. For example, this series includes materials
                            relating to UUP's incorporation and dissolution as a corporate entity,
                            correspondence between UUP, Hartford Life, and Metropolitan Life
                            Insurance Company regarding the excess major medical and group life
                            insurance UUP provides for its members; correspondence regarding lending
                            UUP phone lines to NYSUT, setting up a credit union for UUP's
                            administrative office staff, and some agreements and correspondence with
                            the Communications Workers of America (CWA) which represents UUP's
                            clerical staff. The series also includes such reference materials as
                            agency fee procedures, PDQWL grant application forms, and the policies
                            of the SUNY Board of Trustees for a number of years. No one topic is
                            particularly focused on, although the amount of materials for each
                            subject varies widely. The lobbying materials include handwritten
                            lobbying reports made by UUP members on lobbying days reporting which
                            legislators (or their staff) they met with and their reactions to UUU's
                            concerns.</p>

                            convention. Only a few officers attend the AFL-CIO conventions, while a
                            substantial number of delegates are elected to attend the RAs and AFT
                            conventions as representatives of UUP.</p>
            <p>The materials in this series relate to the conventions of these
                            affiliates and include mailings to all UUP delegates regarding the
                            convention details including administrative information such as hotel
                            accommodations and travel arrangements, as well as correspondence
                            regarding UUP resolutions to be proposed at the conventions. Also
                            included are the materials that the affiliate distributes in connection
                            with the convention, including booklets with proposed resolutions,
                            agendas, promotional literature about programs sponsored by it and/or
                            benefits offered by it, a copy of its constitution, listings of
                            delegates, budget reports, officer reports, daily summaries of
                            proceedings, and news articles or reports relating to key topics of
                            concern. In some instances, particularly in the Reilly years (for which
                            the most information is available), a separate file is included which
                            contains Reilly's copies of some of the UUP and affiliate-distributed
                            materials annotated by him, as well as occasional handwritten notes. The
                            Secretary's files contain the more administrative and logistical
                            materials.</p>
            <p>The records in this series provide an opportunity to examine UUP's
                            interactions with its affiliates in statewide education (NYSUT),
                            education nationally (AFT) and organized labor statewide (AFL-CIO) and
                            the various resolutions it has sought to have adopted by each
                            organization. Additional materials relating to affiliate conventions can
                            be found in the Secretaries' Files, Series 6 of this Subgroup, while
                            materials dealing with the more direct relationship between UUP and its
                            affiliates, such correspondence between UUP and the leadership of these
                            affiliates, can be found in the various subject and correspondence
                            series in this collection. Consult the index to the box and folder list
                            for the exact locations.</p>

          <p>This subgroup was created for records relating to specific projects that UUP
                        was involved in but for which the specific office of origin was unknown or

            <p>In the late 1970s UUP faced the most serious challenge to its position as
                            bargaining agent from the New York Educators Association, an affiliate
                            of the National Education Association. UUP disaffiliated itself from the
                            NEA in 1976. The NEA/NYEA challenge culminated in an election for
                            bargaining agent conducted by the New York State Public Employment
                            Relations Board in December 1978. Through much of 1978, UUP campaigned
                            for its continuation as bargaining agent for SUNY faculty and
                            non-teaching professionals, with the assistance of professional
                            organizers from the AFT and NYSUT field representatives.</p>
            <p>This series is an artificial gathering of NEA/NYEA challenge materials
                            found during the course of processing the collection. The primary
                            records are the "excelsior listings" (poll lists) used during the
                            representation election ballot count conducted on December 22, 1978.
                            They give the names, addresses, and positions of every member of the UUP
                            bargaining unit and the number of the ballot sent to each member. The
                            excelsior listings are in order of the ballot numbers (which were
                            assigned by chapter). The excelsior listings were also hand-marked to
                            indicate who were members of UUP and from which individuals ballots were
                            received to be counted. There are two copies of the ballot count
                            excelsior listings. One set is organized into seventeen separate groups
                            in 1,000 ballot intervals that were used at the actual counting tables,
                            and include a list of the observers for UUP, NEA/NYEA, the State, and
                            PERB for those ballots, instructions for UUP observers, and forms for
                            UUP's observers to record challenged ballots. Although the excelsior
                            listings do not indicate the vote made by each individual, they do
                            provide a record of who voted in the challenge election and whether or
                            not they were members of UUP. The excelsior listings also provide a
                            snapshot of UUP's membership, and are the only records available in this
                            collection that list the entire UUP bargaining unit further annotated as
                            to who was a member of UUP. Also included in this series are campaign
                            materials, the results of a pre-election Harris poll commissioned by
                            UUP, and a series of news clippings regarding the challenge and
                            election.</p>
            <p>Other materials relating to the NEA/NYEA challenge, including
                            correspondence detailing UUP's organizing activities during the
                            campaign, can be found in the subject files of President Wakshull in
                            Subseries 3.1 of Subgroup III; the records of UUP's Treasurer Joseph
                            Drew in Subgroup V; and in the photographs and printed memorabilia in
                            Subgroup VIII, Communications Department.</p>

            <p>During the 1980s and early 1990s UUP worked to correct salary disparities
                            on behalf of its bargaining unit using a fund established in its
                            contracts with the state. The contracts specifically prohibited the use
                            of the fund for across-the-board salary increases and left the
                            determination of the exact allocation of the disparity funds to a joint
                            state/UUP committee. The primary intent of the disparity project was to
                            identify specific categories of employees whose salaries were below
                            national standards, not to address individual salary disparities. This
                            did not prevent many bargaining unit members, however, from writing to
                            UUP to make a case as to why their individual salary was unfair and
                            should be corrected. For the most part, particularly for the latter
                            disparity funds, materials submitted by individual applicants were not
                            retained.</p>
            <p>The records in this series are organized alphabetically within two
                            groups, based on the contract year to which the appeals related. The
                            first set of applications were made in late 1983 and early 1984,
                            primarily by groups (particularly librarians). The application files
                            include correspondence and supporting documentation demonstrating how
                            the applicants' salaries compared locally and with their profession at
                            large, and additional materials supporting their claim for disparity
                            payment. There is no uniform set of materials provided by each group or
                            individual applicant. Also included in this series is correspondence,
                            including additional letters to UUP making the applicants' case for
                            disparity funding as well as individual commentary and complaints
                            regarding being overlooked for disparity payments. The rosters included
                            in this series list by campus and title the disparity payments to be
                            made; it is unclear however if these were drafts or the final copies of
                            the payment rosters. Only group applications are included in this series
                            for the later disparity program in 1987-88. Like the earlier
                            applications, they contain varying amounts of information submitted by
                            each applicant group.</p>

                            and subject files of President Reilly in Series 5 of Subgroup III; and
                            the records of the Disparity Committee in Series 4 of Subgroup IV,

                            creating a plan for the long-term management and preservation of UUP's
                            records. The records of the Archives Committee are included in Series 4
                            of Subgroup IV, Office of the Secretary. It is unknown if the committee
                            specifically solicited historical documents or if an awareness of the
                            committee and its charge prompted members to send to UUP materials they
                            thought were historically important. Regardless, this series is an
                            eclectic mix of materials relating to the Senate Professional
                            Association, the State University Federation of Teachers, the State
                            University Professional Association, and UUP. It reflects activities
                            both statewide and on individual campuses and includes correspondence,
                            meeting minutes, newsletters, negotiations proposals, handwritten notes,
                            and workshop handouts. The records document some of the activities of
                            the American Association of University Professors on SUNY campuses;
                            mailings received by members of SPA welcoming them to that organization
                            and informing them of the issues of the day; meetings of SUFT and SUPA;
                            SPA's negotiations in the early 1970s and UUP's negotiations in the late
                            1970s; and some of the materials distributed to its leadership at the
                            many workshops UUP has held over the years. One folder in the series
                            documents student strikes on the SUNY Albany campus in 1970 and the
                            response of faculty to those activities. Some of the materials in this
                            series duplicate those found in Subgroup II, UUP Predecessors and Early
                            UUP Years, and in the negotiations records in Subgroup VI for the
                            applicable contract years. However, some of the campus-specific
                            materials and the correspondence sent by SPA to its members are unique
                            to this series, as are the set of workshop booklets.</p>

            <p>UUP's Research Department conducts research on a variety of topics to
                            assist UUP's leadership, committees, negotiators, and other UUP
                            constituencies. One method of research is surveys sent to all or
                            portions of UUP's membership. The completed survey forms (for the most
                            part anonymous) often contain handwritten comments from members,
                            documenting not only their thoughts and concerns regarding the subject
                            of the survey, but occasionally broadly sweeping criticism of or praise
                            for UUP in general. The surveys distributed to gather member input on
                            negotiations are included in Series 3 of Subgroup VI, Labor
                            Relations-Negotiations. Included in this series are the completed forms
                            from other surveys conducted by the Research Department.</p>

              <p>The Re-Imagine UUP Committee was responsible for examining UUP's
                                structure and operations and producing a report regarding the type
                                of union UUP was to be in the future. The records for the committee,
                                along with its report, are located in Series 4 of Subgroup IV,
                                Office of the Secretary, supplemented by the project and subject
                                files of President Reilly in Series 5 of Subgroup III. In the course
                                of preparing the report, the Committee engaged the AFT and a
                                research consulting firm to conduct surveys of UUP bargaining unit
                                members. In order to supplement the information gained through those
                                methods, and to cover issues the committee felt it needed more
                                information on, a single page, two-sided survey was inserted into
                                the Voice.</p>
              <p>The insert solicited input on the direct election of officers, term
                                limitations, what UUP should expect from its affiliates, whether
                                affiliations benefit UUP, the make-up of UUP's Executive Board,
                                UUP's lobbying efforts, and UUP's promotion of curricular and
                                pedagogical reforms. Approximately 300 survey forms were returned,
                                most with handwritten comments. No formal tabulated results exist,
                                but the first survey form in the group has percentages written on
                                it. Also included in this series are a number of completed surveys
                                that appear to have been received too late to be tabulated.</p>

              <p>In early 1993, UUP's Research Department conducted a survey of both
                                academic and professional newer members (classified as those who had
                                been employed for less than ten years at their current campus). The
                                tabulated results for both groups are included in this series, along
                                with the completed survey forms for academic newer members only. The
                                four-page survey form solicited information on topics such as
                                possibilities for tenure, ability to obtain continuing appointment,
                                workload, preferred salary mechanisms, availability of child care,
                                flexibility of hours, impact of union participation on career,
                                familiarity with UUP, and ways in which UUP could best serve the
                                needs of newer academic members.</p>

                        records, however, deal more with the mechanics of negotiations and the
                        operation of the Negotiations Committee, than the details of negotiations
                        themselves. The materials in this Subgroup best document the overall
                        negotiations process and the specific issues under discussion for any given
                        contract.</p>

            <p>There was no discernable order to negotiations materials through the
                            1988-1991 contract and during processing they were grouped by the
                            individual contract to which they relate. "Collected Materials" was used
                            to describe materials that were grouped together either by date or
                            subject matter prior to processing, or for materials that were not
                            originally in any order but for which a date or topical order could be
                            readily assigned. At some point, possibly during preliminary processing
                            activities, some of the files now designated as "Collected Materials"
                            were reviewed by someone apparently involved in negotiations and
                            approximate dates assigned to some of the materials. These dates have
                            been written in pencil on the documents. Undated materials were left
                            where they were originally found. During processing, indications were
                            found that many of the files in the 1970s were those of Edward J.
                            Alfonsin (UUP's Secretary from June 1975-June 1981 and member of several
                            negotiations teams), and that many of the materials from the 1980s were
                            from Fred Day (one of the field representatives provided to UUP by
                            NYSUT). However, such materials were only designated by creator when
                            that distinction could be confirmed and it was deemed important to
                            understanding the context of the files.</p>

                                from the files of Phil Encinio, originally an NYSTA-NEA
                                representative, and by November 1971 SPA's Executive Secretary and
                                Executive Director. The "Collected Materials" for the first half of
                                1973 included in this series were the files of Alan D. Willsey
                                (chairman of UUP's Legislation Committee) and they overlap both the
                                1971-1974 contract and the 1974-1976 contract.</p>

              <p>One of the most heavily documented negotiations processes in this
                                subgroup. Multiple drafts and annotated copies of contract demands
                                and language of final contract; transcripts and minutes of
                                negotiation sessions and of UUP negotiations team; notes and
                                correspondence of Tim Reilly, UUP's chief negotiator;
                                correspondence; reports; news articles, petitions, and
                                correspondence regarding UUP actions to protest impasse in contract
                                negotiations; and reports and exhibits prepared for hearing to
                                settle contract impasse. Most of the "Collected Materials" are
                                arranged topically. Salaries, promotion, and health coverage were
                                some of the main issues of concern.</p>
              <p>Also included in this subseries are press releases, proposals, and
                                correspondence regarding contract negotiations and final contracts
                                between the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) and the
                                Public Employees Federation (PEF) with the State of New York. They
                                appear to have belonged to Fred Day, the NYSUT field representative
                                assisting UUP with negotiations. Negotiations for the CSEA and PEF
                                contracts were taking place around the same time as UUP's
                                negotiations with the state. It is unclear if these materials
                                related to other activities that Day was working on at the time of
                                the UUP negotiations or if they were specifically collected for
                                comparison purposes and/or other use in UUP's negotiations.</p>

            <p>This series contains the compiled results of membership surveys conducted
                            by UUP in 1988, 1990, and 1994, as part of its preparations for upcoming
                            contract negotiations. It also includes those survey forms with
                            additional handwritten comments from the member completing the survey.
                            Although for the most part anonymous, these comments document the
                            concerns of UUP members in their own words. Because the information from
                            uncommented forms was already captured in the compiled results, they
                            were not retained as part of this collection.</p>
            <p>Survey topics have included academic freedom and professional
                            development/campus environment; working conditions and benefits; health
                            science centers (1990 and 1994 surveys); part-time employment (1988
                            survey); appointment, evaluation and promotion; contract management;
                            facilities and technology (1994 survey); and salary items. Demographic
                            questions about respondents (such as campus and appointment status) are
                            also included. Compiled results for 1988 and 1990 were generated in
                            various formats-by campus, rank, type of campus (i.e, university center,
                            health science center, four-year college, two-year college) and various
                            other permutations (gender, academic, professional, librarian, research,
                            health practitioner, resident, part-time employees, and UUP leadership).
                            For 1994, only totals and a break down by part-time employees,
                            academics, and professionals are available in this series. See Subseries
                            1.9 and 4.2 in this Subgroup for other compiled results for the 1994
                            survey. For the most part, the 1994 survey forms are organized by
                            chapter, while forms for 1988 and 1990 are arranged by the control
                            number assigned to the form when it was returned to UUP.</p>
            <p>In addition to the regular negotiations survey, as part of negotiations
                            preparations in 1994, a separate "Member Suggestion Form" (which appears
                            to have been distributed in connection with member meetings held on
                            campuses to get input for the upcoming negotiations issues) was used to
                            obtain anecdotal information to support UUP's negotiations demands.
                            Unlike the survey forms, the vast majority of which are anonymous, the
                            member suggestion forms include the name of the individual making the
                            comment. Subseries 4.2 in this Subgroup has some additional member
                            suggestion forms.</p>

              <p>Evelyn Hartman was appointed UUP's chief negotiator in January 1977.
                                In a prior organization effort, these files were labeled as her
                                negotiations files, however with the exception of only a few files,
                                they do not specifically relate to UUP negotiations nor is there any
                                indication of how (or if) Hartman used or referred to these files
                                during negotiations. They appear to be more reference files. This
                                subseries includes third-party reports, including materials prepared
                                by New York State United Teachers, and other education unions such
                                as the National Education Association and state bargaining
                                organizations; correspondence; copies of legislation; and
                                announcements issued by SUNY. Materials dated prior to 1975 relate
                                mostly to NYSUT, local school board/district conflicts (particularly
                                in Rochester), community colleges, assistance provided by NYSUT to
                                universities other than SUNY that were seeking to organize, and
                                collective bargaining issues in general, as well as material
                                distributed at training sessions and workshops for union
                                representatives and negotiators. Also included are informational
                                pamphlets and materials regarding various topics such as affirmative
                                action that were prepared for distribution to union organizations to
                                educate them about the issues and employees rights. Correspondence
                                between NYSUT and its field representatives is also common.</p>

              <p>Correspondence from UUP members to chief negotiator Thomas Corigliano
                                and UUP's President, Tim Reilly, expressing concerns they would like
                                covered in new contract; correspondence among negotiations team and
                                negotiations committee; draft proposals and agreements; transcripts
                                of negotiations sessions not included in main negotiations files for
                                this contract included in Series 1 of this Subgroup; news reports
                                regarding contract settlements between state and other public
                                employee unions; third-party reports; reference files on issues
                                under negotiation; and handwritten notes. These were the files of
                                chief negotiator Thomas Corigliano. The materials were not filed in
                                any overall order; often there was no identifying information on the
                                folders in which they were found and many of the materials were not
                                in folders at all. Folder titles with quotation marks indicate
                                original folder titles; all other folder titles were assigned during
                                processing and often contain overlapping materials and overlap in

          <p>The two series in this subgroup are artificial gatherings created during
                        processing, made up of correspondence files maintained by both UUP's
                        Executive Director/Director of Staff and the President and/or Secretary.
                        They have been weeded of correspondence dealing with specific grievances
                        (which primarily dealt with administrative matters such as notification of
                        the decision by UUP to appeal grievances and setting up hearing dates) and
                        correspondence between UUP and GOER and between GOER and SUNY authorizing
                        the use of employee organizational leave time by delegates, and members of
                        UUP's Executive Board and committees to attend their respective meetings.
                        (Many of the organizational leave correspondence can be found in the
                        individual committee, Delegate Assembly, and Executive Board meeting files
                        included in Subgroup IV, Office of the Secretary.) The records in this

            <p>The Governor's Office of Employee Relations (GOER, also referred to as
                            OER) ensures that all state agencies, including SUNY, observe all
                            policies regarding state employees. It is with GOER that UUP negotiates
                            its contracts and to whom UUP turns when it feels that SUNY is not
                            following the contract or the state's employee rules. The correspondence
                            in this series documents the wide variety of issues that UUP has brought
                            to GOER's attention when it felt that SUNY was attempting to
                            "unilaterally change the terms and conditions of employment" for members
                            of the UUP bargaining unit. The primary correspondents are UUP's
                            President, Executive Director (later Director of Staff), and Associate
                            Director of Staff, and the various directors and assistant directors of
                            GOER over the years. The specific topics covered vary widely, and have
                            included over the years increased teaching workloads, changes in
                            required office hours for faculty, the subcontracting of work by
                            campuses, campus smoking policies, sabbatical leave, promotion
                            guidelines, and clinical practice plans, to name just a few. The
                            correspondence in this series also reflects UUP's concerns, as expressed
                            to GOER, regarding activities of SUNY management seen as inappropriate
                            such as the alleged harassment of grievants, alleged interference with
                            attendance of members at union meetings, alleged disparaging remarks
                            made by SUNY representatives regarding UUP or union activity in general,
                            and in the late 1970s in allowing the presence of representatives of the
                            American Association of University Professors on campus and providing
                            them with meeting space and access to campus mail services in direct
                            violation of UUP's recognition as sole bargaining agent.</p>
            <p>Other correspondence in this series includes formulaic letters from UUP
                            to GOER requesting the commencement of negotiations, correspondence
                            setting up labor management meetings and sometimes listing the issues to
                            be discussed, and requests for information about the bargaining unit
                            (such as listings of employees with certain titles). Correspondence
                            seeking GOER's assistance as a liaison with other state agencies such as
                            the Comptroller's Office and Audit and Payroll regarding dues deductions
                            or other paycheck related matters needing to be solved are also
                            included.</p>
            <p>In addition to correspondence, this series occasionally includes policy
                            statements sent by the director of GOER to all state agencies regarding
                            employee matters, copies of statements or speeches by representatives of
                            GOER or SUNY, and copies the SUNY policies to which UUP was registering
                            its objections with GOER. Many times, however, attachments to
                            correspondence are not included in this series. While the series
                            includes both outgoing and incoming correspondence, they often do not
                            "match up" and responses to UUP's outgoing letters are not included, or
                            at times the UUP correspondence to which GOER was responding is not
                            included. Additional correspondence between GOER and UUP can be found in
                            some of the project and subject files in the collection, particularly
                            those of Samuel Wakshull in Series 3 of Subgroup III; and in the
                            negotiations files in Subgroup VI. The materials in this series are
                            organized by the name of the GOER representative involved. Each
                            individual's title is indicated in the folder title. The "other
                            correspondents" at the end of the series are for other GOER
                            representatives for whom there was not a substantial amount of
                            correspondence and who were initially filed in "general" or
                            "miscellaneous" GOER correspondence files.</p>

            <p>Primarily outgoing correspondence from UUP's President, Executive
                            Director (later Director of Staff) and Associate Director of Staff to
                            representatives at SUNY Central Administration, including the
                            Chancellor, Director of Employee Relations, Employee Relations
                            Associates, and the Vice Chancellors of various areas including Academic
                            Affairs, University Affairs, Employee Relations and Personnel, and
                            Faculty and Staff Relations. The correspondence in this series requested
                            SUNY to investigate practices on specific campuses that UUP objected to
                            or requested clarification on. A wide gamut of issues were covered, such
                            as the application of SUNY policies from one campus to another, vacancy
                            announcements listing below minimum salaries, attendance reporting
                            systems implemented on campuses, the ranking of professional positions,
                            discretionary salary increases, concerns with building security on a
                            campus, and SUNY's patent policy to name just a few.</p>
            <p>The correspondence also documents UUP's requests to SUNY for assistance
                            for individual members encountering problems with insurance coverage,
                            salary increases not reflected in paychecks, and receiving confirmations
                            that temporary appointments have been changed to continuing
                            appointments. There is also correspondence setting up labor-management
                            meetings and listing the issues to be discussed. Also occasionally
                            included are copies of SUNY policies, either issued to all campuses or
                            memoranda sent to the SUNY Board of Trustees. For the most part,
                            however, referenced attachments to outgoing UUP correspondence are not
                            included.</p>
            <p>Additional correspondence between SUNY and UUP can be found in some of
                            the project and subject files in the collection, particularly those of
                            Samuel Wakshull in Series 3 of Subgroup III. The materials in this
                            series are organized by the name of the SUNY representative involved.
                            Each individual's title is indicated in the folder title. The "other
                            correspondents" at the end of the series are for other SUNY
                            representatives for whom there was not a substantial amount of
                            correspondence and who were initially filed in "general" or
                            "miscellaneous" SUNY correspondence files. Included in these latter
                            folders are some materials dealing with a SUNY Women's Conference held
                            in 1986.</p>

            <p><emph render="italic">The Voice</emph> is the official publication of UUP
                            distributed to all members of the bargaining unit. In addition,
                            complimentary copies are distributed to top-level members of SUNY
                            management, lawmakers, and news media organizations in the state.
                            Published on an academic year basis (i.e., each volume runs roughly from
                            August or September to May or June), <emph render="italic">The
                                Voice</emph> regularly carries candidate statements, information on

                            reports for affiliate conventions, and verbatim text of negotiations
                            proposals made by both the State and UUP. Regularly featured topics
                            include contract negotiations with the State of New York; Executive
                            Board activities; chapter events and issues; the SUNY budget and
                            legislative issues affecting SUNY and higher education; increases in

                            campuses, and/or specific departments or individuals on campus;
                            information on candidates UUP endorses for state and national offices;
                            and messages from UUP's leadership, including columns by UUP's President

                            [volume 26] <emph render="italic">The Voice</emph> changed from a
                            newspaper format to a news magazine layout, and became more

                            theme, such as the concerns of part-time employees, women and the labor
                            movement, academic freedom, and SUNY-specific features such as
                            technology, the performing arts, and athletics on SUNY campuses. A few

              <p>Advertisements produced by UUP to coincide with sessions of the state
                                legislature and to raise public awareness of SUNY's needs. Campaigns
                                often focused on the impact of budget cuts on SUNY students and the
                                impact the SUNY system has on the future of New York State. Some
                                "legislative giveaways" carrying the legislative campaign message,
                                as well as some oversized versions of various campaigns are included
                                with the memorabilia in Series 9 of this Subgroup. Television and
                                radio advertisements that accompanied various advertising campaigns
                                are included in the video and audio tapes in Series 6 of this
                                Subgroup. Tentative dates were assigned for some of the materials in
                                this subseries based on information provided by members of UUP's

            <p>Video and audio versions of UUP advertising campaigns, media coverage of
                            UUP rallies and demonstrations, and conferences sponsored by UUP or in
                            which UUP participated. Also included are appearances by UUP's President
                            on public affairs shows, at legislative hearings, Delegate Assembly
                            presentations, and other venues. Copies of the print advertisements that
                            accompanied the advertising campaigns can be found in Subseries 3.1 in
                            this Subgroup. Tentative dates were assigned to some of the materials in
                            this series based on information provided by members of UUP's
                            Communications Department.</p>
            <p>This series also includes audio tapes of most of the 155 "The Best of Our
                            Knowledge" programs funded with a grant from UUP between September 1990
                            and September 1993 and produced by WAMC/Albany. The program, which aired
                            on public radio, was co-hosted by UUP's President Tim Reilly. Reilly
                            continued as host after his term as UUP's President ended. Each
                            half-hour program presented segments discussing research accomplishments
                            at colleges and universities and issues of concern to the college
                            community. The subjects covered were nationwide, not SUNY-specific. A
                            complete index of the topics covered in each program is not available.
                            However, the contents for a few of the last programs are listed in the
                            box and folder list for this series and give a flavor of the types of
                            subjects covered on the program. In addition, detailed listings for
                            episodes 5 though 104 (with a few omissions) are included in the
                            President's project and subject files in Subgroup III in the form of
                            memoranda distributed by WAMC to managers of stations broadcasting the
                            show.</p>

            <p>Black and white and color photographs of individuals, meetings
                            (committees, Executive Board, Delegate Assemblies, workshops, and other
                            gatherings), picketing, lobbying, and news conferences. Photographs are
                            from statewide as well as campus-specific events, with the President,
                            other officers, Executive Board members, and others actively involved in
                            UUP frequently pictured (although often not identified). Therefore,
                            while some photographs are specifically filed by individual, frequently
                            statewide leaders and other persons active in UUP appear in photographs
                            filed by event or committee. Photographs of specific activities were
                            sometimes filed both under the name of the committee responsible for the
                            activity (such as Negotiations Committee or Elections and Credentials
                            Committee) as well as under the name of the event itself (such as
                            Negotiations or Elections).</p>
            <p>Photographs were originally organized in two separate groups-the first
                            containing photographs from the 1970s and early 1980s (organized
                            alphabetically in Boxes VIII.7.1-VIII.7.16), and the second containing
                            photographs from the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s (organized
                            alphabetically in Boxes VIII.7.16-VIII.7.21). Included in the first
                            grouping is a series of photographs from the late 1980s that had been
                            gathered according to the issue of The Voice that they appeared in. In
                            addition, many of the photographs filed by individual name or by subject
                            have production marks and notes indicating that they were used in The
                            Voice at some point. A substantial number of photographs in this series
                            are not identified as to their exact event or the individuals pictured,
                            and The Voice is an important source to further identify events and
                            individuals shown.</p>

            <p>On occasion UUP has created exhibits for its Delegate Assemblies. In
                            addition to including mounted documents and three-dimensional artifacts,
                            the displays have relied heavily on photographs. The mounted documents
                            and photographs used in these exhibits make up this "Exhibits and

              <p>To celebrate its twentieth anniversary in 1993 and its twenty-fifth
                                anniversary in 1998, UUP created an "Archives Room" at its Winter
                                Delegate Assemblies those years. The twenty-fifth anniversary
                                "Archives Room" used the photographs displayed in the twentieth
                                anniversary "Archives Room", supplemented by additional photographs,
                                mounted reproductions of documents, a mounted "time-line"
                                identifying the officers and members of the Executive Board during
                                each presidential administration, various artifacts, and a
                                continuous-run slide projection of UUP photographs. The majority of
                                the photographs are black and white prints, and are roughly arranged
                                by date. Some of the photographs were displayed with captions and in
                                addition to the photographs themselves, photocopies of the
                                photographs with their captions are included in this series.</p>
              <p>The slides used in the "Archives Room" are included in Series 9 of
                                this Subgroup, while a video-tape of the still-images displayed,
                                accompanied by a soundtrack of labor songs, is included with the
                                videotapes in Series 6 of this Subgroup. Also included in Series 6
                                is a documentary history of UUP, including interviews with some
                                individuals actively involved in UUP. Finally, the artifacts used in
                                the twenty-fifth anniversary "Archives Room" are included with the
                                memorabilia in Series 9 of this Subgroup.</p>

                                Assembly. Photographs with captions were originally part of the

                                Some photographs for this exhibit were also obtained from the
                                photographs in Series 7 and photocopies of those photographs have
                                been included in this subseries.</p>

                            publication], and various brochures, advertisements, bumper stickers,
                            and publications. Non-paper records include lapel pins, delegate name
                            badges, legislative giveaways, buttons, t-shirts, canvas bags, and other
                            three-dimensional artifacts. Some of the paper records in this series,
                            such as the Delegate Assembly programs and contract booklets, duplicate
                            the materials found in the respective series within Subgroup IV, Office
                            of the Secretary, and Subgroup VI, Labor Relations--Negotiations. There
                            is also some overlap between the materials in this series and those in
                            Series 3 of this Subgroup, "Publications". This series also includes
                            oversized versions of some of the legislative ad campaigns in Subseries
                            3.1.</p>
            <p>The bulk of these materials (with the primary exception of the oversized
                            legislative ad campaign materials) were collected for display in
                            "Archives Rooms" set up at Delegate Assemblies to commemorate UUP's 20th
                            and 25th anniversaries in 1993 and 1998 respectively. Legislative
                            giveaways and other materials produced after 1998 have been added to
                            this series, as well as some documents encountered during the review of
                            various working files not made part of this collection.</p>
