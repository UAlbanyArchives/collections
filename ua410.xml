      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Office of Graduate Education has its origins circa 1952, with the appointment of Edgar Flinton as the first Director of Graduate Studies.  In the 1960s, the position was retitled "Dean of Graduate Studies."  Beginning in 1971, the office was combined with the Office for Research, and was administered by a group of Assistant Deans overseen by the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies.  These offices were separated in the late 1990s.</p>
      <p>As of 2017, the Office of Graduate Education is headed by the Vice Provost and Dean for Graduate Studies and operates within the Office of the Provost (Academic Affairs).</p>
