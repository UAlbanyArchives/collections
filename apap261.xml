      <p>Tarky Lombardi initially donated his papers to Syracuse University in the late 1960s. In
        2006, the papers were transferred to the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections
        and Archives. </p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Tarky Lombardi was born in 1929 and represented the 49th district in Central New York in the New York State Senate
        as a member of the Republican party. Voters first elected Lombardi to
        his seat in 1965 and he served until retiring in 1992. Earlier he spent six years on the
        Syracuse Common Council, including a number of years as its majority leader. A U.S. Army
        veteran, Lombardi graduated from the New York Military Academy and received a bachelor of
        science degree as well as a juris doctor from Syracuse University. He and his wife Marianne
        had five children.</p>
      <p>While a State Senator, he served on a number of committees. He was chairman of the Senate
        Finance Committee from 1989-1992, the Senate Health Committee from 1971-1989, and the Senate
        Special Committee on the Culture Industry. In addition, Lombardi served as a member of the
        Codes, Education, Judiciary, Rules, and Veterans committees. During his career, Lombardi was
        known for his healthcare efforts, as well as advocating for medical malpractice reform. He was
        chairman of the State Council on Healthcare Financing, and a member of the Assembly on the
        Legislature, Human Resources and Arts, Tourism, and Cultural Resources committees of the
        Executive Committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures. Lombardi was a member
        of the Council of State Governments and chairman of its Committee on Human
        Resources.</p>
      <p>During his career, Lombardi received a number of awards including the Terence Cardinal
        Cooke Award, Legislator of the Year from the National Association for Homecare, the Arents
        Medal, and the Simon LeMoyne Medal. He also introduced legislation to establish the New York State
        Writers Institute at the University at Albany. After retiring from politics, Lombardi
        returned to work at the Syracuse-based law firm of Devorsetz, Stinziano, Gilberti, Heintz,
        and Smith P.C. He helped found the firm in 1966, then known as Lombardi Devorsetz Stinziano
        and Smith, P.C.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Tarky Lombardi, Jr. Papers document only his earliest years in the New York State
        Senate (1966-1967). They are almost entirely correspondence with a few newspaper clippings
        attached to incoming letters. The correspondence is primarily constituent mail and topics vary, but generally relate to a bill pending in the State Senate.  
There is a small amount of correspondence
        with fellow legislators. In all instances, the incoming letter is attached to a copy of the
        outgoing one.</p>
