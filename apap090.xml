      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Thomas "Ed" Mulligan, Jr. (1818-1985) was an Albany Republican who made two unsuccessful attempts to become elected to political office. He hoped to eventually overthrow the reigning O'Connell/Corning Democratic Political Machine. In his first race, in 1953, he ran for Mayor of Albany against the long-standing Democratic favorite Erastus Corning and surprised the city with a powerful campaign that drew more votes than any previous Republican candidate running for that position against Corning. </p>
      <p>Born on March 6, 1918, in Albany, New York, Mulligan attended St. Theresa's Parochial School, Christian Brothers Academy and Siena College where he received the Sigma Omega Achievement Award and was elected night college President as well as night editor of the Siena News. Prior to entering the United States Air Force in 1940, Mulligan worked for radio stations WOKO and WABY and as a staff reporter for the Knickerbocker News. During World War II, he served as a B-17 bomber pilot until he was shot down and taken prisoner by the Germans in 1943. In 1951, Mulligan served as Chairman of the Publicity Committee for the Salvation Army Drive. In 1952, he founded the Albany County Eisenhower Committee and was appointed to the New York State Merit Award Board and the New York State Personnel Relations Board by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. When nominated by the Republican Party to run for Mayor in 1953, Mulligan was employed as a publicity agent for the New York Department of State. He resigned from this position in order to campaign on July 30, 1953, the day his nomination was announced. The 1953 campaign was filled with accusations of corruption against the Democratic city government in areas such as fire safety in the public schools, traffic and highway department neglect, and understaffing of the city police and fire departments. </p>
      <p>He lost the race to Mayor Corning by over thirty-four thousand votes. Mulligan returned to his state publicity job until he was fired by Edward S. Conway, the Republican GOP Chairman, in 1964, at the start of his second political campaign after challenging Conway's leadership of the party. Mulligan lost the 1965 election for assemblyman to Edward Rook, although this campaign was, as was his first, a heated struggle.</p>
      <p>Upon his death, on April 22, 1985, the ownership of Thomas Mulligan's personal papers transferred to author William Kennedy pursuant to provisions in Mulligan's will. Mr. Kennedy then donated the collection to the University Libraries, State University of New York at Albany. </p>
