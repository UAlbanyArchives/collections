      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Capital Area School Development Association (CASDA) is a cooperative organization among public and private schools and the University at Albany's School of Education. Through programming, CASDA provides professional development for administrators, teachers, and school support staff. It is a voluntary self-governed association managed by an executive committee and chief school administrators. Its purpose is to facilitate programs for school employees. Finance is acquired through membership and the University.</p>
      <p>CASDA was first suggested by a group of Schoharie County principals and school officials. Representatives from Schoharie and other schools met periodically in Albany, New York with faculty at the New York State College for Teachers to discuss changes in education and school affairs. The group aimed to network the college with public school teachers and administrators to introduce new philosophies, curriculum, and ideas. The group first convened as CASDA on October 6, 1949, and formed a study council to examine educational needs. Frank W. Frederick, Ph.D., chose the name of the organization, and a ten-member executive committee was formed to manage the association's operations at Milne Hall on the college's campus. CASDA organized during a period when education and the school experience was rapidly changing as a result of post-war expansion. Teachers wanted more development and professional services, and administrators felt a need for research and field services. The college provided these services to village, rural and city school personnel. CASDA's main purpose at the time of its inception was to create a link between K-12 teachers and the college to advance all aspects of education. The State Teacher's Colleges at Albany and Oneonta provided professional seminars. During its first few years of operation, CASDA mostly provided in-service programs for its members or to employees of schools who paid an annual fee to the association. Some of the first programs included television and radio workshops (1954-1957). In 1949, eighteen school districts had joined and CASDA's budget was $2,000. By 1950, thirty-seven schools had joined and by 1968 fifty had joined. Membership cost $.10 per pupil per school and the budget was $33,400. By 1970, BOCES schools became CASDA members. Seventy-three schools from eleven counties belonged to CASDA by 1986.</p>
      <p>The executive committee consisted of administrators from the State Teachers College and local school administrators. Between four and twelve staff members and researchers also served CASDA before the 1980s. The first executive director was Joe Leese, 1949-1952. Other executive directors include Don Denley, 1953-1967; Bernard Bryan, 1967-1970; Al Farnsworth, 1970-1976; and Greg Benson, who took office in 1976. CASDA received federal funding for "Project B" in 1964 to study education in the region. In 1967, CASDA moved to the New York State Education Building in Albany, and in 1971 the association was chartered by the State Education Department. CASDA continued to organize conferences and seminars, and continued to form study councils. The council researched salaries, employee insurance issues, school budgets, and the economics of building construction. New programs included computer education and library media seminars. CASDA held annual administrative meetings, and annual conferences for first-year teachers, executive secretaries and custodians.</p>
      <p>In 1986, the CASDA board consisted of ten members. Four staff members ran day-to-day operations with graduate assistants to support staff. In 1991, CASDA studied the problems of area schools and served 125 school districts with continuing education seminars. CASDA organized conferences for educators, school board members, and administrative staff. In 2006, Gregory Aidala was executive director, and CASDA was considered the third largest educational association in the United States. It is located on the East Campus of the University at Albany, in Rensselaer, New York, and is a study council of the University at Albany's School of Education.</p>

          <p>This series consists of reports and booklets published by CASDA. The bulk of the reports were produced for school administrators and address school management, human resources, and business and legal issues. Many of the reports publish the findings of CASDA's study councils and surveys conducted by researchers. They document size, financial issues, and administration of CASDA schools. Other reports are handbooks for teachers and address curriculum, education philosophy, special programs, and teaching methods. There also are custodian handbooks and bibliographies for teachers.</p>
