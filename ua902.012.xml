      <p>Phillip Leonard Sirotkin was born in Moline, Illinois, on August 2, 1923. He married Cecille Sylvia Gussack on May 1, 1945, and they had two children: Steven and Laurie. He received his B.A. from Wayne State University in 1945, his M.A. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1951, both from the Universtiy of Chicago. </p>
      <p>Sirotkin was a lecturer at the University of Chicago (1949-50), an instructor (1950-52) and an assistant professor of political science (1953-57) at Wellesley College, associate director of Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, Boulder, Colorado (1957-60), executive assistant to the director of the California Department of Mental Hygiene (1960-63), assistant director of the National Institute of Mental Health (1964-66), associate director of NIMH (1967-71) and a consultant at NIMH (1971-73), executive vice president for academic affairs at the State University of New York at Albany (1971-76), and executive director of Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, Boulder, Colorado (1976-). </p>
      <p>n 1967, Philip Sirotkin, while associate director of the National Institute of Mental Health, was part of the First U.S. Mission on Mental Health to the U.S.S.R. In February 1969, the Mission published its report. Three years later, the New York Review of Books published a series of articles on the Soviet Union's commitment of dissidents to mental institutions. R. B. Silvers, editor of the New York Review of Books, wrote letters to all seven members of the Mission requesting that they respond to documents supporting this claim. </p>
