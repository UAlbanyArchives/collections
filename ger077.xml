      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Erich Maria Remarque (the pseudonym of Erich Paul Remark) was a German-born writer most famous for his 1929 work <emph render="italic">All Quiet on the Western Front (Im Westen nichts Neues</emph>), which describes the brutality of World War I from a young soldier's perspective. His literary works include both novels and plays; several of his novels were made into films. Remarque was born in Osnabrck, Germany on June 22, 1898. As a young man, he served as a soldier in World War I and was wounded several times. After the war Remarque supported himself as a librarian, businessman, teacher, editor and journalist. His works were controversial and were accused of being harmful to Germany's national pride; in 1933 they were banned by the Nazis. Claims arose stating that Remarque was the descendant of French Jews.  Remarque's German citizenship was revoked in 1938. He took up residence in Porto Ronco, Switzerland and lived there until emigrating to the United States in 1939. Remarque and his wife Ilse Jutta Zambona became American citizens in 1947. After divorcing his first wife, Remarque married a former Hollywood actress, Paulette Goddard, in 1958. Remarque and Goddard returned to Switzerland and lived there until Remarque's death on September 25, 1970. Remarque is buried in Ronco cemetery in Ronco Ticino, Switzerland.</p>
