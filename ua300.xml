      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Division of Finance and Business was established circa 1977 to oversee a variety of campus departments that had previously operated separately. As of 1992, the departments directly overseen by the Vice President for Finance and Business were: Controller, Human Resources Management, PHysical Facilities, and Financial Management and Budget. The current iteration of this Division is called the Division of Finance and Administration, a name that was adopted in 1998. The Division of Finance and Admininistration oversees a similar range of operations as its predecessor: financial departments and physical facilities.</p>
