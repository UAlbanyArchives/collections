      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The telephone operators division of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) is one of the original sectors of the CWA, 
a union that grew over the years to protect the interests of a large variety of professions. In 1918 phone operators gained 
union representation under the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), but a 1923 strike led to the breakup 
of that union. By the end of the 1940s, however, the CWA blossomed from the National Federation of Telephone Workers, which 
formed in the late 1930s when operators decided it was time to try unionization again. Under the leadership of Joseph Beirne, 
the CWA became national, and in subsequent decades the union grew to include private and public workers in the education and 
healthcare sectors in addition to the original telecommunications members. [1, 1a]</p>
      <p>The operators of the Telephone Traffic Union Upstate (TTUU), today part of the CWA, also have roots stretching back to the 
1940s; the TTUU began in 1945 in Albany, New York as the Traffic Employees Association Upstate Area. Led by Marie McGoughan, who started as general 
secretary of the group before becoming chair of the general committee in 1949, the group members established themselves as 
proponents of better working conditions and wages for telephone operators. December 1949 brought about the first issue of the 
union's newsletter, <emph render="italic">Traffic Calls,</emph> and in 1950 the group voted to change its name to Telephone Traffic Union Upstate, 
New York. Headquarters were situated in three different locations around Albany before moving to Liverpool, New York in May 
1976. [2] Although the union gained membership and support from men over the decades, the group was traditionally led by women 
and has featured many female officers. </p>
      <p>Before they were members of the CWA, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) operators of the TTUU were affiliated with 
the Telecommunications International Union (TIU). [3] The TIU had an executive committee that oversaw the activities of its 
locals, but holes in the TIU constitution led to difficulties in 1984 when the TIU--an independent union up until that point--
decided that it wanted to consider joining forces with the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO 
(AFSCME) or the CWA. TTUU members thought they might be interested in joining the CWA, but it seemed as though the TIU was 
leaning toward joining AFSCME. That difference in wishes, combined with discrepancies over which TIU locals would be able to 
send delegates to a special conference regarding the affiliation question, ultimately led the TTUU to disaffiliate from the 
TIU and join the ranks of CWA phone operators instead. Additional ill-will stemmed from failure of the TIU and TTUU to reveal 
to their members that affiliation with AFSCME would mean a 'substantial increase' in dues and loss of previously recognized 
organizational privileges. [4]</p>
      <p>The legendary breakup of AT&amp;T also provided impetus for phone operators to make an affiliation change. Beginning in 1974, 
the American government brought anti-trust suits against AT&amp;T. Arbitration continued until 1982 when AT&amp;T agreed to dismantle 
the Bell operating system as it had existed for nearly a century. AT&amp;T subdivided in 1984 into seven regional affiliates -- the 
"Baby Bells", so called because the old corporation was known as "Ma Bell." [5] The breakup coincided with the TIU's efforts 
to join AFSCME, and worries over employment conditions under the Baby Bells gave TTUU members more to consider as they made 
the decision to break away from the TIU and turn to the CWA instead.</p>
      <p>The transition from TIU to CWA was gradual; the process began in 1984 but was not resolved until the early 1990s. Correspondence 
between TTUU President Donna Conroy and CWA headquarters in Washington, D.C. shows a slow integration of the TTUU into the 
CWA and some dissension over the number of people to be allowed at the bargaining table. [6] Despite the tentative transition, 
union members were seeing changes in the way they would do their jobs--as well as anticipating the need to fight for the right 
to do those jobs at all--and believed that the bargaining power of the CWA would provide them with the best employment protection. 
Ultimately the group retained its name "Telephone Traffic Union Upstate," but also added "CWA Local 1112" to that title once it 
became affiliated with the larger union.</p>
      <p>Telephone operators cover several distinct areas of phone service. Central office operators handle local and long-distance 
call connections for customers. Directory assistance operators specifically provide phone numbers and area codes to callers 
while switchboard operators are typically employed within private offices to handle interoffice communications as well as 
directing outside callers. [7] As employees of AT&amp;T and its subsidiaries, the operators of the TTUU Local 1112 would therefore 
be responsible mainly for central office and directory assistance work.</p>
      <p>Union membership for phone operators became more crucial through the late 1980s and into the 1990s as automated systems 
began taking over the roles that humans used to perform. While central office, directory assistance, and switchboard operators 
continued to do their jobs, it was often in a background role as they monitored automated systems and stepped in if the system 
was malfunctioning or a caller experienced difficulty navigating it. They also intervened if a caller needed to interrupt a busy 
line in an emergency. [8] But the continued downsizing of phone companies and further introduction of machines that  
replaced working people prompted more reliance on unions like the CWA to support employment of real people and fair working 
conditions for them.  The TTUU operators relied heavily on the ability of the CWA to grieve cases for them as they brought 
up issues against New York Telephone, Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, and other AT&amp;T divisions over the years; 1984 and 1989 were especially 
notable for months-long strikes that involved public relations battles, fights with scabs, and long hours picketing as unionists 
fought for workers' rights.</p>
      <p>In 2001 the TTUU Local 1112 underwent one more name change when the telephone operators merged with two other CWA groups: 
the Graduate Student Employees Union of the State University of New York (Local 1188) and telecommunications workers 
(Local 1104). By retaining their individual group infrastructures (committees, officers, etc.), each local was able to continue 
operating efficiently but with much better bargaining power following the merger. At this time the phone operators (Local 1112) and 
graduate student employees (Local 1188) dropped their old local numbers and joined the telecommunications workers under the 
"Local 1104" designation instead. [9]</p>
      <p>As of 2010, the CWA boasted 1,200 chartered local unions in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. It is also 
affiliated with the AFL-CIO, the International Transport Workers Federation (ITWF), and the Canadian Labour Congress. The 
phone operators remain very active within the union and are known for wearing red every Thursday as a sign of solidarity. [10]</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The telephone operators collection contains a variety of documents illustrating the evolution of the group from its days 
with the Telecommunications International Union (TIU) through its first ten to fifteen years with the Communications Workers of 
America (CWA). The materials represent a variety of activities ranging from everyday office issues to nation-wide concerns, though 
the majority of the collection focuses on local topics. Although the Local 1112 (eventually the 1104) formed in the late 1940s, 
the collection mainly covers the 1970s and later; there is a noticeable lack of material from the union's early days.</p>
      <p>There is a considerable amount of correspondence which the union divided by national and local letters and memos. Many of 
them document decision making by CWA headquarters executive committee members and local executive committee members. Steve 
Early, James Irvine, and Morton Bahr are names that arise frequently on the national level while Donna Conroy, Jane Blaszczak, 
and Kim Young appear often on the local level; all of them were union committee members or officers in some capacity for many 
years and played a significant role in shaping the direction of the union through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The disaffiliation 
from the TIU and affiliation with CWA is well-documented with files showing drafts of new constitutions and by-laws as well 
as letters to the union's lawyers asking for advice on wording and content.</p>
      <p>The collection also has a selection of legal contracts and agreements that the union made over the years, many of which 
deal with the period following the breakup of AT&amp;T and issues within the Bell divisions, specifically NYNEX. There are also 
agreements regarding union affiliation. In addition, there are materials documenting the 1989 strike, scabs, 
and ramifications after the strike. Researchers will find a variety of day-to-day issues represented in the subject files 
dealing with specific offices and special projects. Conventions and seminars are represented in the collection on the national 
and local levels. Beginning in the 1970s, one of the major issues that the phone operators grappled with was the introduction 
of automated recordings that took over the calls that they used to handle, and there are paper documents as well as memorabilia 
reflecting that tension. Many of the union's activities, including strikes and conventions, are represented through photographs.</p>
      <p>There is also a series for membership issues that features grievances as well as applications for membership, resignation 
paperwork, and cases that were not substantial enough to grieve them officially but still needed supervisory input and contained 
personal information on the part of the employee(s) involved.</p>

          <p>This series documents legal activities and relations between the union and telephone company management.  Many of these 
files belonged to Donna Conroy, president, and Kim Young, executive vice president, of Local 1112.  This includes agreements 
and contracts dating from the 1950s to the end of the 20th Century.  The bulk of material in the series, however, relates to 
the 1989 strike, informational picketing, and ongoing mobilization efforts.  The union mobilized its members during bargaining 
in support of new contracts, against office closures, and against robot technologies replacing operators.  Although some files 
mention specific union members, the papers relate to broader union-wide action, such as the 1989 strike.  See Series #6: Membership 
for files on individual union members pursuing their own legal action. The Local 1112 also created several photo albums of 
union activities such as strikes and informational picketing. The photos were removed from these albums for preservation purposes, 
placed in archival-quality photo sleeves, and filed within this series where appropriate.</p>
          <p>Please note that files mentioning specific union members in this series may include individual member information of a 
sensitive nature and are therefore labeled as restricted.  Researchers seeking access to these materials should contact the 
head of archives. </p>

          <p>The union kept its letters and memos according to those whose origins were national and those whose origins were local. 
Therefore, this series is divided into national and local subseries with folder titles retained exactly as the TTUU named 
them. Both subseries are arranged by year, then alphabetically by folder title within each year. The national subseries contains 
substantial incoming and outgoing correspondence from specific offices or people such as James Irvine (CWA vice-president) and 
Morton Bahr (CWA president) or presidents of locals in District One, which covers unions in New York, New Jersey, New England, 
and eastern Canada. The local subseries tend to be divided by group affiliation such as NYTel workers, stewards, and AT&amp;T headquarters.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the files in this series date from the 1980s and 1990s and belonged to Kim Young, executive vice president of 
Local 1112, with a smaller number of files originating from the office of the local's president Donna Conroy.  The material 
documents ongoing union business, the local union's relations with AT&amp;T and management, and day-to-day issues affecting unionized 
offices and members.   Also included are efforts to prevent office closures and programs to assist union members when management 
decided to close offices.  Other materials of interest are employee petitions, major company and union initiatives such as the 
"Safe Workplace Campaign"" which addressed ergonomic challenges faced by operators, and a run of the union's official newsletter, 
<emph render="italic">Traffic Calls</emph>, including its debut issue in 1949.</p>

          <p>This series is arranged similarly to correspondence--the materials are grouped chronologically, then alphabetically within 
each year. There are brochures and other documents from many of the CWA annual conventions from the mid-1980s through 2000, 
but there are also many local events represented such as operator conventions, steward seminars, and other union-related seminars 
offered on topics including leadership and labor laws. The Local 1112 created many photo albums of conferences and union gatherings;
the photos were removed from these albums for preservation purposes, placed in archival-quality photo sleeves, and filed within
this series where appropriate.</p>

          <p>These materials are divided into three subseries--membership services, local grievances, and National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) grievances. The first subseries has information about retirements, applications for union membership, and daily problems 
that needed supervisory intervention but were not serious enough to warrant actual grievance procedure. Local grievances included, 
but are not limited to, issues such as dismissal for poor attendance, need for lengthy sick leave, and wage discrepancies. NLRB cases are more of 
a mixture of individual cases as well as cases where the entire local chose to grieve an issue on behalf of all its members.</p>
          <p>Please note that these files contain individual member information of a sensitive nature and are therefore restricted. 
Researchers seeking access to these materials should contact the head of archives.</p>

          <p>This series contains a variety of artifacts from the TTUU's history, including buttons, bumper stickers, and banners. At least one banner is strike-related, dated 1989, while another is related to AT&amp;T's replacement of live operators with voice-recorded menu options. There are also two hats, a fly swatter with a caption regarding the bugging of phone lines, and a recording of scab messages from a CWA officer's answering machine.</p>
