      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Libby Post has served as press secretary, campaign manager, and media coordinator for
        various politicians and organizations in New York State's Capital Region. Her academic
        credentials include an MA in political communications from the State University of New York
        at Albany. Post's political consulting and public relations firm, Communication Services,[1]
        has worked with a number of Democratic candidates in their quests for elected office. Post's
        work is a combination of her profession as media coordinator and her own political activism.
        Her early work as part of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) Working Group on the state
        level--a group within the ERA Task Force chaired by Democratic State Assemblywoman May W.
        Newburger--can be traced in the records back to 1982. </p>
      <p>In political campaigns, Post served as Press Secretary for Assemblywoman May W. Newburger
        (Democrat--Great Neck); Press Secretary for the Ed Bloch campaigns against incumbent
        Republican Gerald B.H. Solomon from New York's 24th Congressional District; and as Press
        Secretary for Sheila Healy, 6th District Democratic candidate for the Albany County
        Legislature. Post has continued to work with Albany-area candidates, including Sharon Ward
        in her 6th Ward Democratic primary campaign and Nancy Burton's campaigns for City
        Comptroller in 1993 and 1997. Post worked extensively with Helen Desfosses in her 1997 and
        2001 campaigns for City Council President. In 2002, Post helped organize fundraising with
        the Women for McCall-Mehiel group campaigning for Carl McCall during his run for New York
        State Governor.</p>
      <p>In 1986, Post became Media Coordinator for Family Planning Advocates of New York State,
        Inc., which "lobbies on behalf of Planned Parenthood and other family planning groups."
        During her tenure as Media Coordinator for Family Planning Advocates of New York State,
        Inc., Post provided news coverage and press releases on behalf of the lobbying efforts of
        the group, and in 1987, she covered the 10 year anniversary conference celebrated by Family
        Planning Advocates of New York State. Also in 1987, Post became Press Secretary for the New
        York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Inc., providing press releases regarding the
        "Speak Out Rally" held in Albany, New York on March 9, 1987.</p>
      <p>Post has also done a great deal of work with several Capital Region organizations promoting
        gay and lesbian rights. She served as co-chair of the Albany-based New York State Lesbian
        and Gay Lobby in 1989 and oversaw its merger in 1990 with FAIRPAC, a New York City based
        organization, to become the Empire State Pride Agenda. In 1994 she became a board member of
        the Capital District Gay and Lesbian Community Council (CDGLCC). She became president of
        CDGLCC (now referred to as the Capital Pride Center) in April 1999, and later served as
        president emeritus beginning in April 2004. Post continues to be active in the LGBT
        community, and currently contributes to a LGBT political blog on the Albany <emph render="italic">Times Union</emph> website.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Libby Post Papers primarily hold Post's press releases created for politicians and
        political interest groups. Campaign materials for Ed Bloch's 1984 bid for Congress, document
        Bloch's record on various issues with editorial letters regarding his candidacy, voting
        records, and "Bloch For Congress" newsletters. Materials for Helen Desfosses' campaigns for
        city council president are extensive, covering most aspects of the campaign, including items
        from within the campaign such as planning documents and volunteer lists. The materials for
        Nancy Burton primarily document her actions during time as city comptroller between the 1993
        and 1997 campaigns in news clippings and press releases. Campaign materials for Sheila
        Healy's bid for Albany County 6th District Legislator are limited to a campaign brochure and
        seven press releases publicizing Healy's political record. Materials for Carl McCall are
        limited to announcements and invitation lists for a fund raising breakfast. Sharon Ward's
        campaign materials for 1989 consist of a campaign plan for the 6th District Democratic
        primary.</p>
      <p>Press releases for New York State Assemblywoman May W. Newburger that Post created as press
        secretary, outline Newburger's stand on public issues with quotes, voting records, and
        information on Newburger's activities. Also included are files of press coverage and news
        clippings discussing Newburger, not all of which were the result of Post's press releases.
        Post's role as media coordinator for Family Planning Advocates of New York State, Inc., is
        documented by press releases, press coverage, notes regarding the preparation of a
        conference, and an agenda for the organization's 10th anniversary celebration. Press
        releases for, and press coverage clippings regarding, the New York Coalition on Domestic
        Violence, highlight Post's role in the organization, especially her work with the "Speak Out
        Rally" held on March 9, 1987. Post's lobbyist work for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is
        documented in notes of meetings and administrative materials of the ERA "Working Group",
        which lobbied for passage of the Amendment. The ERA files also include press coverage and
        press releases that trace the progress of ratification during this year. There are no
        records of Post's work for ERA before or after 1984.</p>
      <p>The Subject Files that Libby Post collected on various issues relate to her work and public
        interests and include news clippings and informative literature on homosexuality, child
        abuse, Planned Parenthood (affiliated with Family Planning Advocates of New York State,
        Inc.), gay rights, legislative matters regarding reproduction, and state law. The fifth
        series consists of papers collected during Post's tenure as President of the Capital
        District Gay and Lesbian Community Council, 1999-2003. It includes documents relating to the
        running of the council, such as policy statements and financial paperwork, as well as public
        relations materials like event announcements and press releases. The final series contains
        correspondences, agendas, policies, meeting minutes, and other materials related to the
        Empire State Pride Agenda.</p>

          <p>This series contains documents produced during Libby Post's term as President of the
            Capital District Gay and Lesbian Community Council (CDGLCC) from April 1999-April 2004.
            It includes financial statements, internal correspondence, statements of official policy
            and procedure, publications, announcements and information about events such as Capital
            Pride and Empire State Pride Agenda Lobby Day. The agendas, minutes and reports
            presented from both CDGLCC board and committee meetings are found together in the
            Meetings, Agenda and Reports April, 2001-April 2003 folder. Much of the material from
            2000 and earlier was organized into a three-ring binder and has been retained in its
            original order and categories.</p>
