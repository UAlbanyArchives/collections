    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Members of the Freligh family lived in the Niskayuna area during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. George J. Freligh was born ca. 1750 and died in 1800. Dr. Michael Freligh, the son of George J. Freligh of Dutchess County, N.Y., was born in 1770. He settled in Niskayuna in 1788. Freligh served as Albany County coroner, and in 1815 he was elected to the Assembly of the City and County of Albany. He died in 1853. Michael's brother John Freligh settled in Plattsburgh, N.Y., where he witnessed the burning of Plattsburgh during the War of 1812. His first wife Betsy died in 1811, but by 1814 he had remarried a woman named Margaret. The dates of his birth and death are unknown. George W. Freligh, the son of Dr. Michael Freligh, considered seeking his fortune in California, but ultimately remained in Niskayuna on property inherited from his father. George died in 1881. Abram Freligh, the son of George W. Freligh, served as commissioner of highways for the Town of Colonie. He died in 1912. His daughter, Julia Fort Freligh, married Abram Rand. She died in 1959.</p>  </bioghist>
