    <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
<p>The collection is largely organized chronologically and separated based on publication status. Most articles were stapled together with related materials (research materials, original manuscripts, relevant correspondence, published clippingsâ€¦). The donor/creator made notes about article status, but could not always recall if an article had been published. If an article was more likely to be unpublished, it was placed in an 'unpublished' folder. If an article was more likely to be published, it was placed in a 'published' folder. Larger research projects were placed in their own folders and labeled by title. Correspondence not related to article creation was placed in a separate folder.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Henry T. Hettger received an MPA from the University at Albany in 1968. After graduating, he worked extensively in the field of government and private sectors, including a brief assignment with the Office of Presidential Personnel and President Carter's Affirmative Action Project in 1977 before becoming a researcher for the National Archives and Records Administration.</p><p>At the age of 12, Henry Hettger inherited his grandfather's coin collection. This sparked a lifelong love of numismatics. Alongside avid coin collecting, he has authored over 100 articles for Numismatic News, collector newsletters, and Open Archeology, a peer-reviewed journal. He is also a member of the Early American Coppers club and particularly interested in large cents. </p>  </bioghist>
