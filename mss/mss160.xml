    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The laterna magica or magic lantern was an early form of slide projector that was developed in the 17th Century and was used for education in the 19th Century. The slides in this collection were manufactured for public consumption and were intended for educational and entertainment purposes. Most of them were created and sold by T.H. McAllister, a manufacturing optician located at 49 Nassau Street in New York City, but a number of the slides were also distributed by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>
