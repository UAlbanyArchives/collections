    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, was a textile manufacturer in Manchester, New Hampshire. Founded in 1838, by Benjamin Prichard, the Company was the largest cotton textile plant in the world during the 19th century. The town of Manchester, New Hampshire was intended to be a model of a utopian factory city, and most of the people in the town worked for the Company or sold items made by the Company. In 1911, the Company was payed $114,753,340 combined to all of their workers. </p><p> After the first World War, the economy began to decline, and many workers at the company began to strike for better wages and working conditions. Inspired by the United Textile Workers of America, many millworkers did not show up for their shifts. The loss of business during the strikes and new sources of energy eventually led the company to split into two holding companies. However, business continued to decline, and the company closed its doors and file for bankruptcy in 1935. </p>  </bioghist>
