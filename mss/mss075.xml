    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>The Great Western Railway (GWR), which was founded in 1833, linked London with the southwest and west of England, the West Midlands, and most of Wales.  The first train on the railway ran in 1838 and the trains were known to run on broader gauges than other railway services. The GWR updated its lines in the early 20th century and added restaurant cars and steam heaters. In 1914, during the first World War, the government took control of the railroad, but after the war, unlike some railroads, it was allowed to maintain its independence. After the second World War, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on January 1, 1948. In 2015, the name of the railroad reverted back to the Great Western Railway in honor of its founders.</p>  </bioghist>
