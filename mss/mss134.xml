    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Born on Janaury 29, 1929, Dolores I. Carrara (nee Serapilio) started dancing, acting, and singing for radio stations at just three years old. Some of her first radio apperances at the WGY station in Schenectady, N.Y. included dancing for the shows "Children's Jamboree" and "Tell Me A Story." Carrara also did a Christmas Eve special for the WGY radio station in which she sang two songs that were broadcast in South America. As she got older, Carrara modeled for General Electic and was a regular actress on WGY's "FBI in Action" radio show.</p><p>Carrara also took dance lessons from Florence Sanford and eventually moved to Miami with her husband where she worked on shows for the WTVJ commerical radio. Eventually Carrara moved back to Schenectady, N.Y. and became a secretary at a local library.</p>  </bioghist>
