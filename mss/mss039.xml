    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>In 1844, the Auburn Wool Company was founded in Auburn, New York.  Many lawyers, merchants, and doctors gave $100,000 to capitalize the business. While the company had the money, there was no leadership until Samuel Laurie took over the company in 1868. The company purchased the Cayuga Mills, Canoga Mills, and part of Josiah Barber's carpet factory and by 1888, was annually producing 1,500,000 pounds of wool. </p><p>During the 1893 and 1895 national panic, the company went bankrupt, and while investors from Rhode Island were able to keep the company running for another 30 years, in 1929, the company officially sold its assets. The building itself was torn down in 1941. </p>  </bioghist>
