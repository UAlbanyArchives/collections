    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>The Clove Branch Railroad Company was a short four-mile railroad that opened in 1869 by George H. Brown, President of the Dutchess County Railroad. The railroad was supposed to help haul iron ore out of a mine at Sylvan Lake (Dutchess County, New York) and was connected to the Dutchess County Railroad. In 1898 the railroad was abandoned.</p>  </bioghist>
