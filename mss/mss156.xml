    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Herman Prins Salomon (1930-2021) was a Dutch-American scholar specializing in linguistics and primarily the history of Portuguese and Dutch Jews and the Inquisition. He was born in Amsterdam but would relocate in his early life to Montreal and then New York. He studied and obtained a B.A. and M.A. in Romance Languages from the University of Amsterdam, an M.A. in French Literature from New York University, and a Ph.D. in Romance Languages from the Catholic University of Nijmegen.</p><p>Salomon would work at the State University of New York at Albany (now the University at Albany) from 1969 to 2010 for the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures originally as a French faculty member, but would initiate Dutch and Portuguese instruction and a Portuguese minor at the university. He would also become the editor of Yeshiva University's scholarly magazine, the "American Sephardi." In February 2011, he was granted an honorary degree from the University of Lisbon, the Doctor Honoris Causa, as recognition as a leading scholar of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. Due to his research and work on the history of Portuguese Jews in the Netherlands and the establishment of Dutch instruction at the University at Albany, Salomon was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Beatrix in June 2011. </p>  </bioghist>
