    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers of William Titus, Esq. span the years 1828 to 1914. The bulk of the collection, however, dates from the years 1837 to 1877. The collection consist of business, legal and personal correspondence, court and legal records, receipts, lists and advertising circulars. Much of the material relates to Titus' private business ventures into land ownership, his work as a lawyer, representing clients in dealings with the United States War Department's Pension Office during the late 1830's and early 1840's. Materials include government records explaining policies of pension distribution, numerous land deeds representing the transfer of property to Titus or indicate the ownership of other people. In addition, the collection contains some documents listing election results and correspondence addressing voting support from 1853 and 1867. Two documents address Titus as postmaster in Hannibal Centre, N.Y. in 1862 and Auburn, N.Y. in 1866.</p><p>  There is correspondence and other materials relating to Titus' role as warden of Auburn Prison from 1852-1854, as well as of correspondence between Titus and New York State's Executive Branch regarding prisoners and a roster of prison guards and keepers and a description of events and requests occurring within Auburn Prison on unspecified dates. There is also personal correspondence including one from Titus' sister, Betsy A. Titus and another from a nephew, signed Richard.</p>  </scopecontent>
