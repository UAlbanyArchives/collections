    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The New York Archives Conference (NYAC) is a volunteer, professional organization that provides archival education and networking opportunities to archivists across the state working at academic institutions, government repositories, museums, and historical societies. The organization holds an annual conference.</p>

<p>Chartered in 2004, NYAC is the direct successor to the Lake Ontario Archive Conference (LOAC) created in 1975. LOAC was the successor to the New York State Manuscript Curators, 1970-1975, and the 1969 Manuscript Curators' Conference. The organization originally included members from Ontario, Canada and held yearly meetings at sites across Upstate New York or in Ontario. In the early years, meetings were very informal and often had no set program. With the founding of the Archives Association of Ontario as a separate organization in 1993, Canadian membership declined drastically.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s members of the LOAC decided to adopt a more formal organizational structure. At the June 6, 1992 annual meeting, the organization adopted a constitution and bylaws and formally applied for incorporation by The University of the State of New York. Incorporation as the Lake Ontario Archives Conference was granted by the Board of Regents at its meeting of July 24, 1992. The Certificate of Incorporation specifically stated that the organization was to serve Central and Western New York, but from the start archivists from Albany have played a role in the organization, and several annual meetings were held in the Greater Capital District. Shortly after 2000 members of the LOAC Board decided to expand the mission of the organization to include all Upstate New York. Beginning in 2001, the name of the annual conference was changed to the Upstate New York Archives Conference, still sponsored by the LOAC.</p>

<p>At the June 2003 annual conference, in an effort to further broaden the reach of the organization to the whole of New York State, members voted to officially change the name of the organization to the New York Archives Conference, and that name change was formally recognized by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York at its meeting of May 18, 2004.</p>

<p>In June 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, NYAC held its first virtual conference.</p>
