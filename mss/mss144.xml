    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>B.L. Crosby's name is written on the inside cover of the photograph album and it is likely that he is the photographer. Crosby was an engineer. He served as assistant engineer on the Nebraska City Bridge project in 1887 and 1888.  Later, he was resident engineer of the Rulo Bridge, Burlington and Missouri Railroad, Nebraska, and resident engineer of the Bellefontaine Bridge, which crosses the Missouri River between St. Charles and St. Louis Counties in Missouri.</p><p>Nebraska City’s pontoon bridge spanning the Missouri River opened in August 1888. It connected Nebraska City, Nebraska to Fremont County, Iowa. It claimed to be the first such bridge across the Missouri River and the largest drawbridge of its kind in the world. </p>  </bioghist>
