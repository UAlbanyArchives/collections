    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Anthony Ashley Cooper, seventh earl of Shaftesbury, was a British social reformer and philanthropist. Cooper was born on April 28, 1801 and educated at the Manor House school in Chiswick, the Harrow School, and Christ Church Oxford. Cooper received his MA in 1832, and was appointed DCL in 1841. </p><p>Cooper was elected as the Tory Member of Parliament for Woodstock in June 1826 and in June of 1827, he was appointed to the Select Committee on Pauper Lunatics in the County of Middlesex and on Lunatic Asylums. During his time on the committee, Cooper visited many "madhouses," and he sponsored two Lunacy Acts for better care and treatment of lunatics in England and Wales. Cooper also sponsored the Ten Hours Act 1833 bill which introduced laws against child labor, as well as the Mines and Collieries Act of 1842, which protected women and children from being allowed to go underground in coal mines. </p><p>Cooper was a pre-millennial evangelical Anglican and in 1851, he became the President of the British and Foreign Bible Society.  Cooper also studied under Edward Bickersteth, a Christian Zionist. Cooper also served as the first president of the Society of Suppression of the Opium Trade. </p><p>Cooper died on October 1, 1885, and was buried at St. Giles. Cooper was survived by his wife Lady Emily Caroline Catherine Frances Cowper and many of their ten children. </p>  </bioghist>
