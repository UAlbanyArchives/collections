    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>The Ancient and Honourable Company of Fellmongers was a trade guild located in Richmond, Yorkshire, England. Fellomongers remove wool from hides in preparation for leather making. The date of the foundation of the Company is unknown, but it said to have begun in the Middle Ages as a religious fraternity. The Company held power in Richmond, Yorkshire, England and elected the Mayor of the town until 1835. After its powers were taken away by the Municipal Reform Act of 1835, the Company fell apart. </p><p>In 1980, a minute book of the Company was sold, and it prompted a group of people to refound the Company. Today the company includes men and women who were widows of deceased members. The Company seeks to promote fellowship and friendship and provides an opportunity for members to meet people in varying walks of life, not just those in the trade industry. The Company is active in charity reform and gives out prizes for those who do charity work. The Company's website mentions that the University at Albany has a meeting minute book from the original Company. </p>  </bioghist>
