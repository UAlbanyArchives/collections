    <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
<p>Mrs. Elmer Blair, an active member of the New York State Federation of Women's Clubs, and 22 friends who saw an opportunity to make a difference in their community established the Woman's Club of Albany in 1910 based on the motto Let us be such as help the life of the future. The Womans Club of Albany dedicated itself to helping women and children as well as improving conditions in its surrounding area.</p><p> Membership within the Womans Club of Albany (WCA) grew quickly, reaching three hundred members by the end of its second year. In 1913 the WCA was incorporated and in 1919, it purchased its Clubhouse, located at 725 Madison Avenue. The members were divided into multiple departments, sections, and committees, focusing on various goals and issues. Within the first ten years of its existence, the WCA discussed timely issues such as Medical inspection of the Public Schools, began programs to help children stay off the streets, and even campaigned to have a woman member added to the City's Board of Education. By the 1930s and the beginning of the 1940s the WCA flourished; sufficient funds, an array of events and programs, and a membership of six hundred women, including honorary members. Honorary members were often the current New York State Governors wife, such as future President Franklin Delano Roosevelts wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. During this time period, the WCA also raised awareness of international conflict and often contributed to war efforts.</p><p> During the second half of the twentieth century, the WCA attempted to reinvent itself as membership dropped, the number of departments decreased, and the Clubs financial situation began a decline. In the 1970s the WCA tried to overhaul its image by shifting from activities with a civic emphasis to more social ones. By the 1980s the WCA once again tried to revitalize the organization by establishing itself as a center of cooperation among women in New York's Capital District for civic, literary, and philanthropic works.</p><p> Despite these attempts, the WCA continued to decline into the beginning years of the twenty first century. By the end of 2003 only three elderly members remained, the Clubhouse needed repairs, and the future of the WCA was in jeopardy. In 2004 five new women discovered the WCA while attending an event hosted in the rented Clubhouse. They joined the organization and were determined to revive it as a center of activity once again benefiting the surrounding community. Since 2004, the Womans Club of Albany has witnessed great improvement; membership is consistently increasing among women of all ages, the organization has undertaken restoration projects in the Clubhouse, and the WCA is once again involving itself in various philanthropic activities within the City of Albany and the surrounding Capital District.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Womans Club of Albany Records include more than one hundred years' worth of information about all aspects of the Club. The collection is divided into eight series according to the organizational structure and activities of the WCA, flowing from the Board of Directors down to the members. It contains meeting minutes and annual reports for not only the Board of Directors, but for many of the different departments and committees. This will give researchers insight into what members discussed, the goals and focuses of groups within the WCA, and how all of these evolved throughout the years. The WCAs financial history is organized chronologically from the WCAs beginning in 1910 to its revitalization in recent years. This series contains a range of materials, from financial statements to general receipts to loan and mortgage paperwork. Most folders are ordered according to department or committee. As the financial papers were often kept in separate envelopes denoting a particular year and group within the WCA, the archivist retained this original order.</p><p> This collection also documents the membership of the WCA. Researchers should note that the Membership series is broken down into five separate subseries. There are both paper records and three sets of index cards; one set is comprised of early membership cards, another is a set of cards documenting individual resignations and dropped members ranging from the 1920s to the 1970s, and the last set is of cards recording the deaths of members. The use of multiple subseries reflects the original order of the content and preserves WCA's record keeping, which often changed over time.</p><p> Events and programs hosted by the WCA comprise their own series. The WCA hosted a range of events, such as rummage sales, plays, and an annual WCA anniversary dinner. Another series documents items published by the WCA. This includes event calendars sent to the members and copies of<emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph>, the WCAs monthly events publication. A subject file series contains information on a variety of topics, from materials about the New York Federation of Women's Clubs to WCA histories to an engineering/structural report on the Clubhouse.</p><p> Please note that the scrapbook series provides a significant amount of information about not only the WCA itself, but also the ever-changing world around it. Part of the series is unavailable to researchers and being evaluated for possible preservation treatment because of the delicate and fragile conditions of some of the scrapbooks.</p><p> It should be noted that the amount of content often coincides with the ebb and flow of the WCA's history. There is a generous amount of information available from the early decades when the WCA was prosperous, as well from the revitalization of the WCA in 2004 and beyond. There is much material missing from the late 1960s through the 1990s, which is when the WCA was not robust in terms of members or finances. This historical evolution is seen in<emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph>. <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph> began as a glossy magazine in the 1940s, but the WCA continually shortened the publication, transitioning first to a newsletter on legal sized paper and then to a newsletter on letter sized paper by the early 1970s.</p>  </scopecontent>

pertaining to the WCA. A majority of the series consists of various departments and committees expenses, receipts, and annual reports. These were originally kept in envelopes according to department or committee and year. There are also Office and Treasurer Reports spanning from 1912 to 2009, providing information about the WCAs treasury and daily spending. Please note that there are no reports from the early 1930s, 1940s or late 1950s. Financial statements provide an inside look into the WCAs evolutionary financial health.</p><p> The series also contains insurance policies and payments from 1919 to 2005. The WCA retained all mortgage and loan agreements, and payment information, allowing researchers to see when the WCA purchased its house and exactly how long it took to pay off the house and loan. The WCA donated multiple ledgers and accounting books, which are stored separately in oversized, flat boxes.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_7b55af72f52770b30a856d79f53b8c89"

of Albany membership. There are applications for new members which range from 1938-2004. At first the applications were kept by themselves in stacks by year. Then, starting in 1968, the WCA began attaching a copy the Clubs acceptance letter to the new member application. The last few sets of dates (1994, 1996, 2001, and 2004) revert back to the original filing format; without an acceptance letter attached. These membership applications and acceptance letters are filed chronologically.</p><p> The WCA also kept resignation records. It did this in various ways, including index cards and resignation letters. The index cards begin as handwritten cards and transition to typed cards. Amongst the resignations are index cards of members dropped because of unpaid dues. These index cards are grouped into three different categories to maintain original order. Beginning in the 1960s, the WCA started keeping track of resignation letters and letters from the WCA acknowledging the member's resignation. The WCA also kept records of member deaths.</p><p> As with Series 7, Publications, the Womans Club of Albany often changed the layout of the information it published. Every year, the Club produced a new membership list. From 1917-1929, the WCA published membership lists as booklets. In 1933 the WCA switched and began publishing membership lists as pamphlets. As the WCA also switched to monthly news pamphlets around this time, it suggests the WCA mailed out a new membership list, with the monthly news, and the Officers, Departments, and Committees Directory pamphlet once every year. From 1968-1971 the Club published a combination of the Officers Directory and membership in a small booklet.</p><p> Please note that from 1911-1942 the Womans Club of Albany would typically make the Governor of New Yorks wife an honorary member. This included Eleanor Roosevelt during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's tenure as governor. It is unknown when and why this tradition stopped.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_fd063cb65beea952d9c101ea5279d4b4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Early Member Index

The majority of the flyers and advertisements for WCA events are from the twenty first century, with one or two from the 1970s and 1990s. This series also contains event calendars from the 1940s, which were most likely sent out to WCA members monthly. The only evidence of earlier events is from playbooks, dramatic journals, and songbooks retained by the Club. These plays were likely purchased by the WCA for a fee to the playwright, and the women performed these one act plays every few months at an event hosted by the Dramatic Department. Event calendars can also be seen in the<emph render="italic">Monthly News</emph>, found in the Publications series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_eb97ba286bddc62216a3a4298a4fdd4c"

Contents</head><p>The Publications series includes all materials the Womans Club of Albany published throughout its history. Publication of WCA news transitions in the following pattern: Annual Announcements, 1911-1930; <emph render="italic">Monthly News</emph>, 1930 Oct.-1942; <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph>, monthly magazine, 1944-1951 May; <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph>, monthly newsletter on legal size paper, 1951 Oct.-early-1960s; <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph>, monthly newsletter on letter-sized paper, 1970-1973, 1979-1980.</p><p> Although the publication format changed, the information disseminated to members remained unchanged. There is always a message from the President and a calendar of events, followed by reports from all the departments. The constitution and directory of officers and committees are often included as well. In the October 1930 <emph render="italic">Monthly News</emph>, there is a message from the WCA President that talks about the transition from yearly news to monthly. She states that the Board of Directors decided to give monthly announcements a year-long trial, because it believe that this would be a more convenient and accurate method of keeping members informed. At the end of the message from the President, member input is solicited, favorable or otherwise. It is assumed that the new news layout received positive feedback, as the WCA published news monthly for the next twelve years, until 1942. There are no monthly news pamphlets from 1943 found in this collection, so it is unknown whether there were any published during that year. In 1944 the WCA began publishing <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph>. <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph> was a magazine the WCA published every month except for June, July, and August. The first editorial explains that the magazine is a WCA project that was started by Mrs. William Arnstein, who was the advertising manager. The WCA published its news in <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph> for the next three decades, but the layout changed. In October 1951 <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph> transitioned from a magazine to a newsletter printed on legal-sized paper. The farewell issue of the magazine informs members about the upcoming changes, but gives no direct reason for it. In the mid-1960s <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph> varied between a small booklet-like format and a legal-sized newsletter. From 1970-1973 the WCA printed <emph render="italic">The Messenger</emph> on letter-sized paper. The only other issues are from 1979/1980 and these are also printed on letter-sized paper. It is unknown how the WCA published news in the intervening years and afterwards.</p><p> Also included in the Publications series are house rental pamphlets, WCA informational pamphlets, and programs. The house rental pamphlets give a brief history of the Clubhouse as well as pricing information and payment policies. An information pamphlet published in 2007 was aimed at attracting new members. It gives information pertaining to the WCA as well as the costs and benefits of being a member.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f38714a18a889217732fa678ae79813f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual

ranging from photographs of the Clubhouse and members to general correspondence to songs and poems. This series houses materials on the New York State Federation of Women's Clubs and the General Federation of Women's Clubs. It also contains newspaper clippings about the WCA and its members. Many clippings from the early twentieth century mention Mrs. Edward Cameron, who was very involved in the Albany community.</p><p> There is an item in the general correspondence, pre-dating the establishment of the Woman's Club of Albany. A letter to Mrs. Blair about joining the Club is dated 1908, two years before the WCA was founded. It is unclear whether the date is correct.</p><p> The "Exes" File consists of materials related to former Board members. The self-proclaimed "Exes" held an annual event on the anniversary of the WCA's founding.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_69c06b71fe465b89ef4a817a8cc4a3a0" level="file"><did><unittitle>General
