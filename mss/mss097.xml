    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>The Newburgh, Dutchess, and Connecticut Railroad was chartered on September 4, 1866 originally as the Dutchess and Columbia. The railroad company began using the Connecticut Western Railroad and the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railroad lines in 1871. The company also combined railroads under George H. Brown, including the Harlem Extension Railroad, the Pine Plains and Albany, and the Hartford and Providence Railroad. </p><p>On August 5, 1876, the D&amp;C was sold and on January 25, 1877 it was renamed the Newburgh, Dutchess, and Connecticut Railroad. The railroad operated through the Dutchess Junction and included a locomotive repair ship, a paint shop, and a train yard. The company also had a steamboat that transferred passengers across the river to and from Newburgh. In 1907, the railroad merged into the Central New England Railway, and smaller tracks began to be abandoned. In 1969, the railroad was merged into Penn Central and became the Beacon Secondary Track. The remaining part of the original railroad is now part of the Metro-North Railroad. </p>  </bioghist>
