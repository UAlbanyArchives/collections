    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This artificial collection contains materials from late 19th and early 20th Century America and Britain relating to shorthand. Materials include a British shorthand manual; a booklet on laws, rules, and information for shorthand reporters in the state of New York; the by-laws and constitution of the New England Shorthand Reporters' Association; and The Third Book of Phonetic Reading, a guide to English phonetic shorthand reading and writing. The last item is written a phonetic variant of the Latin alphabet. Materials in this collection represent the two primary approaches to shorthand writing: orthographic (an alternative to the traditional Latin alphabet) and phonetic (a phonetic variant of the Latin alphabet).</p>  </scopecontent>
