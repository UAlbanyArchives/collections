    <head>Biographical/Historical Sketch</head>
<p>Materials in this collection represent the two primary approaches to shorthand writing: orthographic (an alternative to the traditional Latin alphabet) and phonetic (a phonetic variant of the Latin alphabet). These items were presumably acquired by University at Albany library staff to complement the library's collection of American and British literature.</p>  </bioghist>
