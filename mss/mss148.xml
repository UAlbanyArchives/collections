    <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
<p>Established in 1901 in Delmar, N.Y., a hamlet in the town of Bethlehem, the Delmar Progress Club is a women's organization located in the Capital Region of New York State. The organization joined the New York State Federation of Women's Clubs in 1904, the General Federation of Women's Clubs in 1916, and was incorporated in 1929. The first president was Mrs. Sherman B. Rouse who served from 1901-1906.</p><p>The Delmar Progress Club was responsible for many community developments as the town of Bethlehem grew in the 20th century. In 1912, the Club raised money for books to establish the first free library in town and in 1913 organized the Delmar Free Library Association. The library was staffed and administered by Club volunteers for nearly two decades.</p><p>In addition, the Club named streets and numbered homes making the town eligible for mail delivery to residences. The Club's Civic Betterment committee petitioned the town to provide garbage collection, and it also is credited with leading the effort to establish the Town Planning Board.</p><p>Today the Delmar Progress Club remains active and engaged with the community and offers social and educational activities for its members.</p>  </bioghist>
