    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Edgar Melton Miller travelled to Ecuador in 1901, working as a correspondent for the Ecuadorian Association Limited, a British company that took over the American Guayaquil and Quito Railway Company. The Guayaquil and Quito Railway company invested in a national engineering project that developed and improved railway infrastructure within Ecuador, to connect the Capital, Quito, with an important coastal economic hub, Guayaquil. </p><p>Miller titled his manuscript "The Ecuadorian Association Limited from Plymouth Rock to Quito, Ecuador. – Or a Yankee's Glimpse of South America. – Description, Travels and Incidents of Actual Experiences with Adventures, Facts and History, Civil Engineering in the Cordilleros los Andes and Border Sketches in the Interior of Ecuador, N. S. de Colombia and Peru by E. Melton Miller. – Correspondent." In the margins, Miller explains that notes made on his journey from March through December of 1901 were rewritten in October of 1904. </p><p>Throughout the manuscript, Miller provides detailed political and social histories of the countries and regions he passed through. His journey started aboard a steamship and he set sail from Ellis Island, New York. After stopping briefly in Havana, Cuba, Miller then sets sail for Colón, Panama. After traveling across Panama, Miller sails to Ecuador from the Pacific Coast of Panama. While in Ecuador, Miller describes in detail the natural environment, the Indigenous people he encounters, the agriculture and economy of the nation, and the difficulties of engineering the railway through the Andes mountains. </p><p>Miller was also the author of "The Socialist Party in the U.S. of America in 10 articles," written  around 1910.</p>  </bioghist>
