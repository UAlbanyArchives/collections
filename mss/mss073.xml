    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Charles K. Gardner was born on June 27, 1787 in Morristown, New Jersey. Gardner's family moved to Newburgh, New York. Gardner was educated at a private academy in Morristown, New Jersey and went on to receive a degree from Columbia College. Gardner was active in the U.S. Army until 1818 where he held many high ranking positions including brigade inspector and lieutenant. Gardner resigned from the Army in 1818 and later wrote many books about the Army and books about political issues. Gardner served as a U.S. Post Office Department auditor in Washington, D.C. from 1829 to 1849 due to his friendship with Governor DeWitt Clinton. Gardner also served a surveyor general in Oregon and as a clerk in the Treasury Department. Gardner was married to Ann Eliza McLean. Gardner died on November 1, 1869.</p>  </bioghist>
