    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Boston and Maine Railroad was a U.S. Class I Railroad in New England. The Railroad was chartered in New Hampshire on June 27, 1835 and officially opened in 1836. Throughout the late 19th century, the company acquired multiple smaller railroad companies in other parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In 1910, J.P. Morgan took control over the railroad, however by the 1920s there was discontinuances and multiple routes ended. The railroad filed for bankruptcy in December of 1970 and it was purchased by the Guilford Transportation Industries for $24 million. In 2006, the industry became Pan Am Railways, which still exists today.</p>  </bioghist>
