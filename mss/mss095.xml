    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>The New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Company (NH) operated from 1872-1968. The NH was formed on July 24, 1872 and consolidated the New York and New Haven Railroad, the Hartford and New Haven Railroad, and the Old Colony Railroad (OC) companies.
The Old Colony Railroad opened in 1845 and went throughout Massachusetts. </p><p>J.P. Morgan gained control of the NH railroad in the 20th century and built a network of electrified trolley lines. The railroad ran throughout New England and went from New York City to Springfield, Massachusetts through Connecticut. </p><p>With the rise of automobiles, the NH began to lose money and the federal government filed an antitrust lawsuit, forcing the NH to stop its trolley system. In 1935, the NH declared bankruptcy. While parts of the railroad remained, the NH filed for bankruptcy two more times in 1961 and 1969. Eventually the railroad merged with the Penn Central System and parts of the railroad are part of the Metro-North Railroads and owned publicly by the states.  More information about the Railroad may be accessed in the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Company Records, 1849-1926 (mss094).</p>  </bioghist>
