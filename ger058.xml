      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Paul Leser was born on February 23, 1899 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the youngest
                of Wilhelm and Helene (Rikoff) Leser's three children. He attended schools in
                Frankfurt and was graduated from the Goethe Gymnasium in 1917 with his Abitur. That
                year, Leser was inducted into the German Army and served in World War I; he later
                became ill and recuperated in the Army Hospital. During his hospitalization, he
                began taking classes at the University of Bonn. In 1919, he became a member of the
                Nerother-Bund, a part of the German youth movement which was founded by the brothers
                Karl and Robert Oelbermann. Also in that year, he returned to the University of Bonn
                to study under his mentor Fritz Graebner, one of the principal exponents of the
                cultural-historical approach to ethnology. He graduated from the University of Bonn
                with his Ph.D. in 1925.</p>
      <p>Leser held positions at the Frankfurter Bund für Volksbildung and at the Ethnological
                Museum in Frankfurt before becoming a Privatdozent for Ethnology at the Darmstadt
                Institute of Technology. During this time period he became involved in the case
                against Dr. Julius Lips of the Raustenstrauch-Joest Museum, who was accused by Leser
                and others of plagiarizing from the works of Graebner, Schmidt, and Koppers. The
                case dragged on until 1933, when many of the participants were removed from their
                positions by the Nazis. Though the case took up much of his time in the early
                1930's, his main interest was his own work on the history of the plow. In 1931, his
                most renowned work Entstehunq und Verbreitung des Pfluges was published (it was
                eventually reprinted in Denmark in 1971).</p>
      <p>In 1936, because of the increasingly hostile political climate in Germany, Leser was
                forced to immigrate to Sweden. He took a position as translator for Folk-Liv in
                Stockholm. In 1941, he immigrated to the United States. Leser served in the United
                States Army in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy from 1942-1945. After the war, and a
                brief stint as a civilian employee at the U.S. War Department, Leser returned to the
                world of academia. Beginning in 1947, he held positions as Professor of Anthropology
                at Olivet College in Michigan, Black Mountain College in North Carolina, and The
                Hartford Seminary Foundation in Connecticut. In 1967, he retired from his teaching
                position at the Hartford Seminary and became an Emeritus member of the faculty. At
                the time of his death in December of 1984, Leser was a Research Professor of
                Anthropology at the University of Hartford. Leser died in Hartford at the age of 85
                and was buried in the family plot in a cemetery in Frankfurt am Main.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Paul Leser Papers consist of 95 cu. ft. of materials, 1850-1984. The collection,
                rich in family history, documents, and correspondence, documents not only the life
                and career of anthropologist Paul Leser, but also contains materials pertaining to
                Leser's sister, Maria Lingemann and her husband Heinrich Lingemann, and earlier
                members of the Leser family. Although the collection contains correspondence between
                Paul and his brother, Albert (Leser) Lestoque, a separate collection, the Albert
                (Leser) Lestoque Papers, documents the life and career of Paul Leser's brother as

                documents, 1882-1984; 2) Diaries, notebooks, account books, address books,
                1914-1983; 3) Family and legal correspondence, 1850-1984; 4) Maria (Mira) and

                topics, notebooks, 1915-1974; 13) Photographs, negatives, slides, ca. 1900-1980; 14)
                Manuscripts, reprints and publications by other authors; 15) Pamphlets; 16) Hartford

          <p>This series contains Paul Leser's correspondence with family members and
                        legal counsel. Much of the post-war correspondence deals with issues

                        Germany. This includes a lengthy correspondence between Paul Leser and the
                        other heirs to the Leser family properties, including brother Albert
                        Lestoque, niece Bettina Coon and nephew Walter Lestoque, as well as with
                        family lawyers Wolf Wassermeyer, Günter Kofferath, Agnes Küsel-Meise.</p>

          <p>Maria (Mira) Lingemann (b. January 20, 1894; d. May 23, 1964) was the older
                        sister of Paul Leser. Her husband, Heinrich Lingemann (b. September 23,
                        1880; d. June 29, 1962), was a lawyer by profession until he was forced by
                        the Nazis to retire in 1938. In the years immediately following the end of
                        World War II, Lingemann was recalled to public service in Germany and served
                        as Oberlandesgerichtspräsident of the province of Nordrhein, Germany,
                        helping to reshape the judicial system of postwar Germany. The materials in
                        this series have been divided into two sections, the first being the papers
                        of Maria Lingemann. These consist of documents, some early writings, diaries
                        and notebooks, and correspondence. The largest amount of correspondence is
                        between Maria Lingemann and Paul Leser and dates from 1913 until her death
                        in 1964. The Heinrich Lingemann materials consist of a small number of
                        documents, typescripts, correspondence pertaining to Lingemann's activities
                        in post-war Germany, and several case files, the most notable being that of
                        Otto Bräutigam. In addition to Bräutigam, other notable correspondents
                        represented in the Heinrich Lingemann papers include Konrad Adenauer,
                        Heinrich Brüning and Emil Niethammer.</p>

          <p>The Graebner series is of interest to researchers in the history of
                        anthropology and ethnology, and specifically those concerned with the
                        cultural-historical approach to ethnology which Graebner spearheaded.
                        Graebner was Leser's mentor and perhaps the greatest influence on his
                        academic career and scholarly interests; Leser remained loyal to Graebner's
                        anthropological methodology even after it had fallen out of favor in
                        academic circles.</p>
          <p>Graebner was born in 1877 in Berlin. He received his Ph.D. in history at the
                        University of Berlin in 1901; his dissertation was on a topic in medieval
                        history. He went on to become a research assistant on the staff of the Royal
                        Museum of Ethnology in Berlin, where he classified South Seas materials. In
                        1907, he became an assistant at the Raustenstrauch-Joest Museum. During this
                        time, he, along with Bernhard Ankermann, developed the method of
                        Kulturkreis, which examined the geographical diffusion of clusters of
                        cultural traits. This development represented a break from the
                        biological-evolutionary concepts which dominated anthropology at the time.
                        Graebner thus remained true to his historical training and became one of the
                        principal exponents of the cultural-historical approach to ethnology.
                        Although this methodological approach was later abandoned by ethnologists,
                        Graebner did exert lasting influence on ethnology in central and northern
                        Europe, particularly on the Vienna school of Kulturkreislebre. In the later
                        years of his life, he became the director of the Raustenstrauch-Joest
                        Museum; he was forced to resign this position due to illness in 1928. In
                        1934, he returned to Berlin, where he died.</p>
          <p>The series contains important published and unpublished manuscripts,
                        photographs, and some correspondence (1920--1937) of both Graebner and his
                        wife Paula. It also contains materials related to the articles written by
                        Joseph Henninger and Paul Leser in honor of the 100th anniversary of
                        Graebner's birth in 1977. Above all, the series helps illuminate the
                        importance of Fritz Graebner, the man and the ethnologist, in the life and
                        work of his student Paul Leser.The Graebner series is divided into two
                        subseries and arranged alphabetically within the subseries. The series is
                        divided into materials by Graebner and materials about Graebner. Materials
                        by Graebner include: correspondence, photographs/negatives, book reviews,
                        offprints, notebooks, and published and unpublished manuscripts. Materials
                        about Graebner include: correspondence between Leser and Henninger, notes
                        for Leser's writings on Graebner, newspaper articles by Leser about
                        Graebner, and writings by both Leser and Henninger.</p>

          <p>The Lips series is of interest not only because of the plagiarism case
                        itself, but also because of the way the case reflects the academic and
                        political climate of Germany in the early 1930s. The case began in 1928,
                        when Martin Block, Lips' assistant at the Raustenstrauch-Joest Museum,
                        complained to Johannes Lehmann, director of the Frankfurt Museum and head of
                        the Association of German Ethnological Museums. Among other grievances, he
                        charged Lips with plagiarizing the anthropologists Fritz Graebner, Wilhelm
                        Schmidt, and Wilhelm Koppers in his work Einleitung in die vergleichende
                        Voelkerkunde. Lehmann and his assistants, Ernst Vatter and Paul Leser,
                        documented the plagiarism and quickly became embroiled in the controversy.
                        The case (or cases, as many different charges and countercharges were
                        filed), eventually reached the courts and involved many prominent German and
                        Austrian academics. It also became a political conflict, played out in the
                        newspapers, as Lips was a member of the Social Democratic Party. The Social
                        Democratic newspapers supported him, while the more conservative papers used
                        the charges as an excuse to attack Lips' character. The case, for all
                        intents and purposes, ended when the Nazis came to power in 1933. Beyond the
                        political and academic aspects, the case is also of note as it helps to
                        illuminate Leser's continuing interest in academic honesty, plagiarism, and
                        the critique of sources.</p>
          <p>The case is well represented by correspondence (1926-1940) between most of
                        the individuals involved, newspapers (1927-1939), manuscripts, reviews,
                        reports, legal papers, and professional opinions on the charges. There is
                        little material on the final disposition of the case(s) and there are no
                        transcripts of actual court hearings.</p>
          <p>The Lips series contains materials relating to the charges of plagiarism
                        filed against Dr. Julius Lips by Paul Leser, et al. The series includes
                        correspondence between many individuals involved in the case and the
                        correspondence of the Deutscher Museum Bund relating to the case. It also
                        contains drafts of manuscripts about the case, Leser's critically annotated
                        copies of Lips' publications, reviews of Lips' Einleitung in die
                        vergleichende Voelkerkunde, and professional opinions regarding the merits
                        of the plagiarism charge. The series contains newspapers with articles about
                        Lips and copies of newspaper clippings about the case. The series also
                        includes subject files on cases related to the original plagiarism
                        charges.</p>

          <p>The Jugendbewegung Collection is divided into three sections. The first
                        section contains photocopies of the handwritten account by Wolfgang Kaiser
                        of the activities of the Nerother Bund youth group from October 1928 through
                        the year 1931. The second section contains clippings, materials and some
                        correspondence pertaining to different aspects of the youth movement. The
                        final section contains examples of Jugendbewegung periodicals, primarily
                        from the 1920s and 1930s, but also contains examples of youth-oriented
                        periodicals dating into the 1980s.</p>

          <p>This series contains clippings, notes, brochures and other materials on a
                        variety of subject areas. One series of files contains newspaper clippings
                        on the family estate in Bonn/ Plittersdorf (1964-1984), which chronicle the
                        property and surrounding area in local newspapers from its ownership by
                        Leser family to the eventual conversion into a recreational park
                        (Leserpark). Other files contain conference materials, materials on the
                        plow, including photographs and early publications. Also contained in this
                        series are a collection of postwar U.S. and occupation newspapers, primarily
                        circulated to U. S. citizens working in postwar Germany.</p>
