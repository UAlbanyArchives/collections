      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civic organization
	  devoted to influencing constructive change in the finances and services of New York City 
	  and New York State government.[Citizens Budget Commission: About the Citizens Budget Commission,
	  http://www.cbcny.org/about.html Accessed July 18, 2006] The inspiration for the group was New York City's inability
	  to manage its budget. The CBC took on the responsibility of analyzing and evaluating New York
	  City's finances. This information was used to create recommendations and reports designed to
	  help New York City. This responsibility was expanded from New York City to state government
	  in 1984. The CBC believes that the interests of the citizenry of New York is of foremost 
	  importance and should guide their actions and responses.[ "A Profile of the Citizens Budget Commission,"
	  Series 6, Box 1, Folder 21, 1995.] </p>
      <p>The CBC was founded in 1932 during the Great Depression when Jimmy Walker was mayor of New York City. 
	  When Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor in 1934, New York City, like the rest of the nation, was in a poor 
	  financial position. LaGuardia worked to resolve New York City's financial problems. The CBC offered criticism
	  and advice throughout this period, which is documented in the news clippings in the collection. The CBC conducted
	  research and released reports meant to be unbiased based on the needs of the people and intended to be what was
	  best for New York City. Out of this time of financial struggle grew the Citizens Budget Commission. Another 
	  financial crisis in New York City's history occurred in the mid-1970s. A combination of generous welfare 
	  spending in the 1960s and a stock market decline in the 1970s put New York City in financial peril. One 
	  example of advice the CBC gave New York City during this time was to urge the city to provide only essential 
	  services and even at that level to do it economically.["Citizens Budget Commission Urges City Provide Only Essential Services, 
	  Phase Out 'Pernicious' Practice of Borrowing for Recurring Expenses," Series 7, Box 6, Folder 1, April 14, 1975.]</p>
      <p>For over seventy years the CBC has acted as the financial voice of reason for New 
	  York City and more recently for all of New York State. CBC's changing responsibility
	  to include all of New York State is explained in their 1984 annual report. The CBC became
	  concerned when state government violated rules of state and local finance in their budget
	  practices.[ "Annual Report: 1984," Series 3, Box 1, Folder 16.] The most recent annual report in the records from 1992 reports on a committee the 
	  CBC created to research the connection between the City of New York and the rest of the state on 
	  fiscal responsibility. Some of the results revealed that New York City is the source of about one-third 
	  of the entire state's revenues while 20% of New York City's revenues are received through state aid. This 
	  committee was designed to help solve the "finger pointing" dilemma that statistics such as these caused between New York City and New York 
	  State.["60th Anniversary Report: 1932-1992," Series 3, Box 1, Folder 17.]</p>
      <p>Today the CBC is led by a president who oversees a research and administrative staff. 
	  The board of trustees are under the guidance of a ruling chair. The CBC's current function is nearly
	  identical to its purpose in 1932 when it was first created-convincing New York to act wisely with its money.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) contain information on the financial 
	  outlook of New York City from the 1930s to the 1990s. The majority of information in the records 
	  contains research, statistics, updates, suggestions, and summaries of New York City's financial standing.</p>
      <p>Administrative information is available in the form of minutes, photographs, and personal
	  information about members of the board of trustees. The meeting minutes of the CBC for the board
	  of trustees and its members end in 1973. Publications date from 1931-1999. The bulk of the records 
	  are from the reports and releases series. Some of the releases correlate to the reports with exact 
	  dates for each series capable of being found and compared through the chronological order they were filed in.</p>
      <p>Related Collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives can be found in the subject
	  guides for Social Activists and Public Advocates and Public Servants and Politicians.</p>

          <p>The Citizens Budget Commission has held an annual dinner since 1932. 
		  The annual dinner celebrates influential individuals. This series contains 
		  dinner programs and invitations. Many of the programs have pictures of the honorees. 
		  In 1993, a speech was given at the annual dinner by Vincent Tese, who at the time was 
		  the director of economic development for New York State. The written version of this 
		  speech is in this series.</p>

          <p>An oversized, bound book of news clippings holds content
		  about New York City's financial struggles from 1934-1941. Many of the 
		  articles contain information about Fiorello LaGuardia, Mayor of New York 
		  City from 1934-1945. The news clippings are from New York City newspapers 
		  such as the New York Times and the Long Island Press. There are both photocopied 
		  and original news clippings. Many of the news clippings from the 1960s and 1970s 
		  are about Mayor John Lindsay and his efforts to fix New York City's budget problems.</p>

          <p>The publications all deal with New York City and its financial status. 
		  Some of the material in this series is in report form, but is not included 
		  in the reports series because it is bound. Included in the publications are 
		  a series of pocket summaries (small pocket sized cards) that summarize New York 
		  City's finances year by year. The CBC Quarterly, a CBC newsletter publication, 
		  has nearly its entire run included in the series, with only a couple issues missing.</p>

          <p>Some of the releases are linked to the reports in Series 8, 
		  but due to their varying nature and bulk, have been separated. 
		  Releases include memorandums, transit information, statements, notices, 
		  information on reports that were released simultaneously, and information 
		  on a wide range of other topics related to New York City's financial situation 
		  from the 1930s through 1990s, and on all of New York State from 1984 to the 1990s.</p>

          <p>The main purpose of the reports issued by the Citizens Budget Commission 
		  is to recommend how New York City, and beginning in 1984 New York State, 
		  could save money and better their financial situation. The reports include 
		  long-term and short-term studies. The size and complexity of New York City's 
		  budget has resulted in a need for continuous revision over the years. The first 
		  folder is undated, but due to its significance of listing some of the reports is 
		  housed first in the series. The remainder of the series is in chronological order. 
		  These reports document financial issues of concern from the 1930s to the 1990s.</p>
