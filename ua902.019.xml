      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>The School of Social Welfare at the University at Albany was founded in December 1963.
        Dr. Richardson L. Rice served as the school's first dean and, in 1964, began efforts to
        establish a two-year master's program in social welfare. The first class of twenty-seven
        students entered the master's program in the fall of 1965 and graduated on June 11,
        1967.</p>
      <p>Dr. Maureen Didier joined the faculty of the School of Social Welfare in August 1967 as
        associate professor directly after receiving her doctorate in social work from the Smith
        College School for Social Work. Didier later served as associate dean beginning in 1972.</p>
      <p>In honor of the School of Social Welfare's 25th anniversary, Didier and the Rev. Clinton
        Dugger, a 1967 graduate, served as co-chairs of a yearlong silver anniversary celebration. The oral history project, conducted 25 years after the first class of students
        entered the master's degree program, was one part of that celebration.  Other activities included a Convocation, exhibits in the Dewey Library, creation of a special anniversary song, alumni dinners, and a lecture sponsored by the Ringel Institute.</p>

        conducted by Mary McCarthy. </p>
