      <p>Deon Tumblin (1976-2004) was convicted of the February 2000 strangulation and beating death of a 75-year-old Texarkana woman. He was sentenced to death and was a prisoner on Texas' Death Row since 2001. In November 2004, Tumblin hanged himself in his cell with a sheet.</p>
      <p> Beginning in 2005, then Sage Graduate School student Karli Keator embarked on a project entitled "Deon Tumblin: A Case Study." As part of this effort she traveled to Texas to conduct research and collected materials related to Tumblin's life and legal case.</p>
      <p> Keator is now director of the National Center for Mental Health and Juvenile Justice and program area director at Policy Research Associates for childrenâ€™s behavioral health policy, trauma, and juvenile justice initiatives.</p>
