      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Born in Albany as Michelle DeMarco, Michelle Crone was a notable driving force in the
        lesbian and women’s movements both at the local and national level for almost 30 years. Her
        long career as a grassroots activist and organizer focused primarily on internal cooperation
        and rumor control within the various activism movements she was involved in. An interest in
        theater and film led her to producing performances within the women’s festivals of the 1980s
        and the establishment of her own Albany-based production company, Elword Productions. Crone
        became a national leader in the lesbian political activist movement, serving important roles
        with both the 1987 and 1993 national marches, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, an as
        a central leader of the National Lesbian Conference of 1991.</p>
      <p>Michelle DeMarco graduated from Albany’s Vincentian School in 1968 and immediately
        volunteered for the anti-poverty VISTA program. She served as a welfare rights worker in the
        Blue Ridge Mountains and helped to establish a crisis intervention network and other social
        programs in the Virgin Islands. She attended the College of the Virgin Islands for a period
        where she studied anthropology and sociology.</p>
      <p>During much of the 1970s, DeMarco was spending half her years in St. Thomas and half in the
        Albany area. In 1972 she joined the Capital District group Lesbians for Liberation, a
        radical feminist organization that heavily influenced the local women’s movement. By the
        mid-1970s, DeMarco was a member of a variety of separatist feminist collectives in the
        Adirondacks and Vermont, such as A Women’s Place in Athol, New York, Crone Hill in Hoag’s
        Corners, New York, and Redbird near Burlington, Vermont. In 1976 she began to go by Michelle
        Crone and helped start Gypsy Silver, a collectively-owned and operated business that
        provided vegetarian catering, taxi, and general handyman (or handywomen) services.</p>
      <p>Crone became involved with large women’s festivals beginning with the Michigan Womyn’s
        Festival in 1979. She would directly contribute to the organization of over 25 festivals
        throughout her career. She became interested in solving internal conflict and in the
        development of effective communalist approaches to organization and the decision-making
        processes. Throughout the 1980s Crone continued her involvement with the Michigan festival
        and also served as coordinator for Robin Tyler’s Southern Women’s Music ? Comedy Festival
        and West Coast Music ? Comedy Festival, and helped lead the Full Circle Festival: Equinox
        ’89 at the end of the decade.</p>
      <p>Crone was admitted into the State University of New York at Albany through the Educational
        Opportunities Program (EOP) in the fall of 1981. She majored first in theatre, yet also
        fulfilled interests in film, women’s studies, and anthropology. She graduated with honors
        1986 with a degree in film history and anthropology and later became a mentor in the Women’s
        Studies Internship Program, helping dozens of young women gain experience in activist
        movements.</p>
      <p>In 1983, Crone became a central organizer of the Seneca Women’s Encampment for a Future of
        Peace and Justice, again helping to define the group’s communal structure and organizational
        process. The encampment aimed to build a representative and diverse community with a
        non-hierarchical decision-making process and provide a safe, legal space for civil
        disobedience actions. They demanded a halt to the deployment of nuclear missiles abroad and
        camped outside the Seneca Army Depot near Romulus, New York, which was the rumored nuclear
        storage site and staging-ground for the export of nuclear weaponry to Europe. Crone was the
        first staff member and received $200 a week to coordinate logistics, manage donations and
        permits, assist with office and media work, and manage orientation for new women. The
        encampment was active from 1983 until at least 1987, performing a variety of civil
        disobedience actions that included symbolic candlelight vigils and “peace puzzles” outside
        the depot’s main gate to chaining themselves to the fence, sneaking inside the fence to
        plant trees, and even camping on the depot’s runway. One planned action proposed to place a
        symbolic condom (a bed sheet) on a model missile just inside the base. Members of the
        encampment were arrested by military police multiple times, and the group often conflicted
        with the local populace and police.</p>
      <p>With her contacts developed during her time a numerous festivals, Crone started Elword
        Productions in 1986, and for the next decade the company brought nationally known feminist,
        lesbian, and gay performers to the Capital District. Acts included comedian and lesbian
        activist Robin Tyler—who worked with Crone at a number of festivals—and JEB (Joan E. Biron),
        a photojournalist and documentarian filmmaker who attended the Seneca Women’s Encampment.
        Elword also produced future lesbian activist and Grammy award winner Mellissa Etheridge in
        the late 1980s when Etheridge charged $200 a show to play in Albany.</p>
      <p>By 1986, gay men and lesbians felt they were under political threat across the nation. The
        AIDS crisis was growing disproportionally within gay communities and the discomfort with
        homosexuality in popular political discourse led to the marginalization of the crisis and
        strong accusations that Ronald Reagan’s administration was ignoring and underfunding health
        organizations and research into the disease. Gay men and lesbians began to witness calls for
        forced testing and concentration camp-like quarantines for gay men in popular discourse.
        Moreover, in 1986 the Supreme Court ruled in <emph render="italic">Bowers v. Hardwick</emph>
        that a Georgia sodomy law was constitutional. The case was particularly offensive to gay men
        and lesbians because it featured police impropriety and the act in question was consensual
        and took place in the defendant’s bedroom. In the ruling, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger
        cited ancient prohibitions to homosexuality – effectively arguing that gay sex was illegal
        in any context.</p>
      <p>This feeling of external threat and the deaths of many gay men due to AIDS, radicalized the
        gay and lesbian activist movements. In early 1987 the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT
        UP) was started in New York City and Michelle Crone joined the movement’s Albany chapter.
        Plans began to circulate for a national march on Washington and Crone’s experience with
        grassroots activism, logistics and organizational structure, and civil disobedience made her
        a candidate for a leadership role. Furthermore, her advocacy for a variety of leftist causes
        meshed well with the movement’s attempt at progressive coalition-building. The theme of the
        March was “For Love and For Life, We’re Not Going Back!” and the movement demanded legal
        representation of homosexual relationships, repeal of sodomy laws, the banning of
        discrimination by sexual orientation, a gay civil rights bill, money for AIDS research and
        health centers, and progressive pro-choice and anti-apartheid causes.</p>
      <p>Crone became involved during the March’s early stages, serving on the planning committees
        for hiring, legal, and logistics. She became a member of the New York Regional Committee and
        was then elected as the region’s representative to the National Steering Committee. Here she
        helped manage merchandise sales, budget, health, media, on-site logistics, and the
        organization of PWA (People with AIDS) groups. Most notably, Crone was selected at the
        National Civil Disobedience Coordinator for the March and managed the action at the Supreme
        Court to protest the <emph render="italic">Bowers</emph> ruling. The structure of the C.D.
        action was akin to that of Crone’s earlier groups, with activists divided up into “affinity
        groups” each with a heath monitor and spokesperson that represented the group’s interests to
        the larger spokescouncil that make decisions. With the theme “Out and Outraged: Love, Life,
        Liberation,” between 650 and 850 activists were arrested on October 13th, 1987 on the steps
        of the Supreme Court, making the demonstration the second-largest act of Civil Disobedience
        in the nation’s history. The action established nonviolent civil disobedience as a viable
        protest tactic for the gay and lesbian activist movement.</p>
      <p>In 1986, Michelle Crone attended an international conference of lesbians in Geneva,
        Switzerland where she became disappointed at the coordination of American lesbians at the
        national level and she began advocating for a national conference. In 1989 she organized a
        National Planning Meeting in Durham, North Carolina to coordinate a conference that would
        discuss and implement a national lesbian agenda and foster a unified national lesbian
        movement with a common vision. Crone chaired the Entertainment Committee and the
        Structure/Process Committee and again implemented a collectivist organization that was
        driven by consensus and prioritized minority representation. For two years the Interim
        National Office was essentially Crone’s kitchen in Albany. In 1991 the National Lesbian
        Conference was held in Atlanta, Georgia, where lesbians of color made up 50% of
        representatives and lesbians with disabilities constituted 20%.</p>
      <p>By the late 1980s, Crone grew dissatisfied with the organization of women’s festivals.
        Together with Kathleen Mahoney, Susan Fuchs, Barbara Savage, and Mandy Carter began <emph render="italic">Rhythm Fest: Women’s Music Art ? Politics</emph>, an annual
        humanist/progressive women’s festival that ran from 1990 until 1996. The festivals were
        women-only affairs with some men tolerated only for maintenance work. Again Crone was
        process-focused and made efforts to manage internal dissent and cooperation. She instituted
        “rumor control” as a process and often solicited feedback and evaluations from workers and
        attendees. Rhythm Fest also focused on the recognition of minority groups and featured
        special camping areas for women over 40, disabled women, women with children, “chem-free,”
        “chem-tolerant,” clean ? sober, S?, biker girls, quiet women, and rowdy women. Like similar
        festivals, Rhythm Fest sometimes had issues with public nudity, with an incident forcing the
        festival to move from Georgia to North Carolina.</p>
      <p>Crone became involved with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobby group, during
        the late 1980s. She served on the host committee for the 1991 Creating Change Conference and
        served as the NGLTF’s grassroots organizer for the upcoming 1993 National March on
        Washington. Crone was also involved in organizing the 1993 march during its early stages,
        serving as a member of the Interim Coordinating Committee. For this march she was elected to
        both the large National Steering Committee and to the 12-member Executive Committee, and
        served on the Outreach and Communication/Media Subcommittees. Her title with the NGLTF was
        updated to March on Washington Coordinator where she managed outreach and merchandizing for
        the lobby group, as well as directed their marketing plan, ran a canvassing campaign, and
        produced NGLTF march events and activities. Locally, Crone managed the transportation of the
        New York AIDS Memorial Quilt to Albany and the addition of names from the Capital
        District.</p>
      <p>In 1994, Crone was selected as Events Coordinator for the Cultural Festival at Gay Games IV
        in New York City which was held on the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Gay Games is
        an athletic and cultural festival that began in 1982 features LGBT athletes, artists, and
        entertainers. Gay Games IV boasted over 10,000 athletes, more than those that competed in
        either 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona or the 1996 Games in Atlanta. The athletes competed
        in a number of locations around the city, from college pools and city recreation centers to
        Central Park. Michelle Crone directed the Cultural Festival which included performances by
        LGBT entertainers such as Ian McKellen and Robin Tyler.</p>
      <p>Crone continued her activist efforts into the mid-1990s. She spoke at various pride parades
        and rallies and joined the Gay ? Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Locally, she
        had been a member of the New York State Lesbian ? Gay Lobby, where she was charged with
        local community organizing, since the late 1980s. When that group evolved into the Empire
        State Pride Agenda in 1994 she was appointed to its Board of Directors.</p>

              efforts which Michelle Crone was involved with in some way. Unlike the remainder of
              the Activism series, Michelle Crone may not have been directly involved in organizing
              these efforts.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains material concerning Michelle Crone's production company,
              Elword Productions, which focused on creating events and performances in the Capital
              Region that would appeal to women and the LGBT community. This includes many files of
              performers that include biographies, correspondence, published reviews, riders, and
              technical specifications. Performers were musical groups, comedians, theater
              performers, and others that generally focused on feminist or lesbian issues. The
              subseries consists primarily of promotional material, and administrative records for
              the company are scarce. There is a substantial amount of material from comedian and
              actress Lea Delaria, whom Crone worked with on numerous occasions.</p>

          <p>This series primarily consists of personal correspondence between Michelle Crone and
            her friends and personal acquaintances. Crone’s personal life often overlapped with her
            professional and political life, and thus, many letters discuss topics from other
            series. Postcards and greeting cards were retained only when they possessed
            informational content. Additionally, the “Resumes” folder contains several version of
            Crone’s resume, documenting a number of events and activities that she was involved with
            until 1996.</p>
