    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers of Hans Staudinger reflect his professional, political, and cultural activities in Germany and the United States. His teaching materials concentrate on economics and sociology and are world-wide in scope. Materials are in English or German, with the correspondence and lecture notes pertaining to the New School for Social Research being predominantly in English.</p><p> The collection contains articles, books, diplomas, passports, photographs, scrapbooks, Festscrifen, and memorabilia of Hans Staudinger and members of his family. It also contains correspondence; handwritten and typed drafts of lecture notes, speeches, and addresses; teaching and research materials; and publications by Hans Staudinger and members of the New School for Social Research. The concentration of material is in the period of 1940 through 1960, with early biographical material dating from 1907 and some items dating through 1980.</p><p> Included in the collection are records of the activities of Dr. Else Staudinger (first wife of Dr. Hans Staudinger) on behalf of the American Council for Emigrés in the Professions, Inc.</p><p> The correspondence and other items relating to the Staudinger family are of interest because of the importance of the individuals involved. Dr. Staudinger's father, Dr. Franz Staudinger, was a philosopher and sociologist, a consumer activist, served as a Lutheran pastor and university professor, and wrote on ethics, philosophy, and religion. His sister, Louise Federn-Staudinger, was a renowned sculpturist. His brother, Dr. Hermann Staudinger, considered to be the founder of molecular chemistry, was a university professor who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1953, was noted for his inspirational teaching, and was the author of over 500 books and papers in the field of organic chemistry. His, nephew, Dr. Hansjürgen Staudinger, was a professor of physiological chemistry and Director of the Biochemical Department at the University of Giessen.</p><p> Other correspondence (with over 200 individuals and organizations) covers Staudinger's many interests and activities: university education, aid to exiles, Deutsche Theater, public utilities, assistance to colleagues and students in publishing their writings, arrangements for publishing his own works. Of special interest might be the correspondence and records pertaining to foreign scholars and other professionals rescued from the Nazis; the activities of the American Council for Emigrés in the Professions, Inc., and the Rockefeller Foundation in their behalf; and the correspondence on the efforts to resettle these individuals in the United States. There are materials which relate to the professional activities of Dr. Hans Staudinger as a member of the various ministries in Berlin between the years of 1918 to 1932, and also which deal with his extensive efforts to bring about an expanded cultural exchange between Germany and the United States after the end of the Second World War.</p><p> Holdings relative to the New School deal with its inception under Alvin Johnson, historical items from the observances of the School's 25th and 40th anniversaries, the work of the Rockefeller Foundation in aiding exiles, and copies of publications by 26 members.</p><p> Typescripts of Staudinger's articles, speeches, books, and book reviews are held in the manuscript section of the Collection, together with many of his publications. (Published works can be found in the book section by using the card catalog.).</p><p> The bulk of the collection consists of lecture and research materials, Topics with large amounts of materials are: Ecology, Economics, Education, Electricity, Energy, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, German Business and Government, Common Market, Industry and Labor, Inflation, Leisure Time, Money, Peace, Philosophy, Politics, Population Growth, Psychology, Religion, Socialism, Sociology. These research materials include pamphlets, clippings, and some correspondence with individuals who were experts in the specific field.</p><p> The Hans Staudinger Papers are of interest to researchers in the fields of economics, sociology, educational history and theory (especially on the university level), history of German-speaking exiles. Researchers in the fields of science might want to examine the correspondence and publications of Dr. Hermann Staudinger, his wife, Dr. Magda Staudinger, and his son, Dr. Hans Jürgen Staudinger.</p>  </scopecontent>
