<p>Erich Von Kahler was born on October 14, 1885 in Prague. Kahler studied at the University of Munich, the University of Berlin, the University of Heidelberg, and the University of Freiburg. Kahler eventually received his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1911 and left Germany in 1933 because he was Jewish and deprived of his citizenship under Hitler's reign. Kahler lived in England until 1938, when he emigrated to the United States. </p><p>Kahler taught at a variety of Universities in the United States including The New School, Black Mountain College, Cornell University, and Princeton University. Kahler was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and wrote many books on politics, technology, and science. Kahler was married to Josephine Sobotka, and later to Alice (Lili) Loewy. Kahler died on June 28, 1970, in Princeton, New Jersey and was survived by his wife and stepdaughter. </p>  </bioghist>
