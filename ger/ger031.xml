    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Hans Elias was born on June 18, 1907 in Darmstadt, Germany. Elias went to Wekkunstschule Darmstadt where he studied drawing until he enrolled at the Technical University of Darmstadt where he studied mathematics, zoology, and physics. Elias received his doctorate in 1931 and began to teach at various schools in Germany. Prior to the start of World War II, Elias began teaching at the Jewish country Herrlingen and in 1935 he joined his family in Milan, Italy. While in Italy, he began to study cinematography and received a grant from the Swiss aid organization to produce an educational film on the development of amphibious eggs with Ernst Rust, Wilhelm von Mollendorff, and Wolfgang Bargmann. </p><p>On April 1, 1939, Elias and his family emigrated to America. Elias was offered a position to teach Biology at Middlesex University. During this time, his wife Anneliese Blumenthal, who he had met in Italy, had two children and they became American citizens on November 27, 1944.  Elias left the University in 1944 and began working for the Center for Communicable Diseases (CDC) in Atlanta, where he promoted educational medical films. In 1953, Elias was appointed associate professor of anatomy, and in 1960, full professor at the Chicago Medical School. During his time at the Medical School he published a variety of manuscripts and essays. </p><p>In 1973, Hans moved back to Germany for a one year research program at Heidelberg University. In 1975, Elias  moved back to California and taught at the University of California and City College of San Francisco until his death on April 11, 1985.  </p>  </bioghist>
