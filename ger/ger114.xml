    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Aufbau began publication in 1934 as a newsletter for the German-Jewish Club of New York and was published in New York until 2004. Aufbau was relaunched as a monthly publication in Zurich, Switzerland in 2005. It originally served as an informative club newsletter, but, over time, the publication's articles also began to focus on international events, especially the treatment of German Jews under the Nazi regime. During the late 1930s and World War II, Aufbau was one of the leading anti-Nazi publications of the German press in exile.</p>  </bioghist>
