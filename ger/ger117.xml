    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Dr. Salome Gluecksohn-Waelsch (1907-2007) received her Ph.D. from the University of Freiburg, Germany in 1932.  As a Jewish scientist, she was fired from her academic position at the Univrsity of Berlin and forced to flee Hitler's Germany one year later with her first husband, biochemist Rudolf Schoenheimer. After a period of three years without employment, her first position in the United States came in 1936 as a research associate at Columbia University, a position she held for 19 years. Finally, in 1955, she was offered a full-time faculty position in the Department of Genetics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where she developed on of the first genetics courses given at any medical school in the United States. </p><p>It was not until late in her career and later in life that Gluecksohn-Waelsch was recognized for her major contributions in developmental genetics.  Among these awards, in 1979, Gluecksohn-Waelsch was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and, in 1993, she was awarded the National Medal of Science.</p>  </bioghist>
