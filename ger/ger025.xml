    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Greta Hartwig was born on April 19, 1899 in Vienna, at the time the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She was the daughter of Theodor Hartwig (born Theodor Herzl, later changed to differentiate himself from the famous Zionist), a noted German philosopher and advocate for free-thinking, and younger sister to Mela Hartwig, a well-known artist and author. Raised in a musical family, Greta was attracted to all forms of performing arts, her wide range of talents leading her to create the "One Woman Shows" that she became known for.   </p><p>Dr. Kurt Manschinger, also known by the nom de plume Ashley Vernon, was born in 1902 in a Viennese suburb. A precocious youth with a talent for music, Kurt was schooled by the famous Austrian composer Anton von Webern during his teenage years. Eventually, Kurt would receive his doctorate in musicology from the University of Vienna in 1926. After establishing himself as a figure in the Austrian theater scene, Kurt would meet Greta as the starring actress in one of his plays.  </p><p>Fiercely critical of fascism, Greta and Kurt were forced to flee their home country of Austria after its annexation by Nazi Germany in March 1938. First, the two fled to nearby Prague, where an inability to perform led to Greta's first foray into a writing career. Later, when the Hitler regime completed its annexation of Czechoslovakia, Greta and Kurt were forced to relocate to London in May 1939 where they helped found the anti-fascist literary cabaret "The Lantern", which hosted many of their fellow emigres who were fled the ever-rising violence of the Third Reich. The next year, the two would relocate for the final time, this time to New York City, and begin to re-establish themselves as mainstays in their respective artistic endeavors.  </p><p>It was in America that the two found the most critical and commercial acclaim, with Greta successfully tutoring several students into prominent roles in film, stage, and television, while Kurt began to write operas. The most famous of these, "The Barber of New York", quickly became a critical and commercial success, being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1954. In appreciation of their newfound home, both Greta and Kurt would become naturalized American citizens in April 1946.  </p><p>Kurt died at home in 1968 while performing at his piano for a group of friends. Greta, never fully recovered from the loss of her husband, and passed away in April 1971 on vacation in Florida. Mela Hartwig Spira died in London in 1967, her husband Robert following just days later.</p>  </bioghist>
