    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Thomas O. Brandt was born on November 18, 1906, in Vienna, Austria.  After completing his doctoral degree in Germanic and English languages and literatures in 1933 at the University of Vienna, he worked in Vienna as a freelance writer, editor, critic and lecturer.  His publications included Der Ewige Kreis, an anthology of modern Austrian poetry, and Der Froehliche Gasthof, a novel.</p>

<p>In 1938, Brandt emigrated to the United States and found a position as a research assistant in German Literature at Harvard University. From 1939-1943, he served as Senior Master at the Lakeside Preparatory School in Seattle, Washington.  He married Esther L. Myhre (Heidi) in 1942 and became a U.S. citizen in 1943.  The birth of sons Christopher (1943), Andrew (1946) and Peter (1947) followed.  From 1943-1944, Brandt was a German instructor at Oregon State College and then professor and department chair at William and Mary College from 1945-1947.  He spent 1944-1945 working for the U.S. Office of War Information, first as a field representative and editorial assistant in London, and then as editor and chief of the German translation section in New York.</p>

<p>From 1947 to 1966 Brandt taught German at Colorado College where he eventually became full professor and Chair of the Department of German and Russian. There he initiated several foreign student and teaching exchange programs and founded the Max Kade Deutsches Haus.  From 1967 to 1968, the year of his death, Brandt was a professor of German at the University of New Hampshire at Durham.</p>

<p>Brandt had a diverse and active career.  From the mid 1950s to the late 1960s, he presented many lectures on topics related to Germanic studies and American culture as experienced by Europeans, including a lecture series funded by the U.S. Department of State (1957, 1965) and one at the Goethe Institut in Mexico City (1966).  Both series included lectures broadcast on local radio stations.  In 1954 and 1956, he led American graduate study groups in Europe and, in 1961, he was invited by the government of the Federal Republic to lead a study tour through Germany.  He spent 1956-1957 on a leave of absence from Colorado College as a visiting professor for the University of Maryland in Stuttgart, where he published several articles in the Stuttgarter Zeitung.  Brandt also taught at Middlebury College (Vermont), Deutsche Sommerschule during the summers of 1960 and 1962.  While on sabbatical in 1963, Brandt travelled to Spain, Mallorca, France, Switzerland and Germany, where he continued his writing.  On a leave of absence in 1965, he travelled and lectured in Europe and was a participant in the Internationaler Germanisten Kongress in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>In addition to fulfilling his duties as a professor, Brandt held several offices in various Germanic studies organizations.  He served as President of the Mountain-Plains Chapter of the American Association of Teachers of German (1955-1957) and was a member of the National Advisory Board for Wayne State University's Junior Year Program (1966-1968).  From 1963-1968 he was a member of the Editorial Board for Universitas in Stuttgart and also served as Managing Editor for the German Language Quarterly, 1962-1964.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Thomas O. Brandt papers are of interest to researchers of German exile literature, Germanistik (study of German language and literature) and academic and cultural developments in post-war United States and Europe.  The collection contains some biographical information on Thomas Brandt, particularly as related to his professional activities and correspondence with students and numerous publishers.</p> 

<p>The bulk of the collection consists of copies of Brandt's works dating from his pre-emigration days in Vienna to the time of his death in 1968.  Poems, many short stories and essays, vignettes, dramas, articles and reviews, novels, lectures and two books appear in the collection.  In addition, there are some offprints of Brandt's journal articles.  Also of interest are the notes and annotations by Heidi Brandt, the author's wife, on many of the works throughout the collection.  No official documents related to Brandt's position with the Office of War Information (1944-1945) appear in the collection.  But one vignette, "Civil Service Goes To War" and a few references in his correspondence deal with Brandt's attempt to gain employment with the government and his impressions of his work there.</p>

<p>Brandt published his work in English and German language academic journals and serials.  His articles appear in publications ranging from scholarly journals to newspapers such as the Colorado Springs Free Press, Brandt's "hometown newspaper."  His publications demonstrate his active engagement in the academic arena as well as a continuous and thoughtful examination of his environment.  In addition to publishing book reviews and scholarly research about German language and literature, he wrote about the need for academics to publish, language acquisition, his observations on the American higher education system, aspects of American culture in contrast to European society, politics and travel.</p> 

<p>Brandt was a prolific story writer as well as an essayist.  The collection contains copies of Brandt's unpublished novels, including Stern im Nebel, which concerns the 1933-1938 period.  Brandt's short stories cover a wide range of topics from the whimsical to the satirical.  His works often stem from personal experience.  Stories such as "Schatten auf Mallorca" and "Eines Tages in Seville" draw from Brandt's impressions of Spain's cultural and political climate during his travels there.</p> 

<p>The poetry found in this collection spans Brandt's entire writing career.  In 1960, he published a German/English volume of poetry, Gedichte - Poems, and the children's book, Andy, or When I'm Famous.  Both works contain lithographs by Heidi Brandt.  His poetry shows influence of the German Romantics; prominent themes are nature, the seasons, childhood, love, and death.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Brandt remained an active and prolific writer.  The largest portion of his correspondence deals with his attempts to get his works published.  Letters to and from publishers such as Piper, Otto Walter, Carl Hanser, Claassen, Mohrbooks, Kiepenheuer und Witsch, Hoffmann &amp; Campe, Nymphenburger Verlagshandlung date from 1960-1967 and chiefly discuss publication of the author's short stories, "Vignetten und Skizzen" and the story, "Schatten auf Mallorca." 
Although Brandt published many of his articles, most of his novels and short stories were not published.  There is also some correspondence concerning the publication of Brandt's 1960 German/English volume of poetry (Dyva &amp; Jeppsens Bogtrykkeri, Copenhagen).  The letters between Brandt and his former students and colleagues from the Lakeside Preparatory School exchanged during WWII show him to be a well-respected and dedicated teacher.</p>
