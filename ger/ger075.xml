    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Eugene I. Rabinowitch was born on April 27, 1901 at St. Petersburg, Russia, the son of Isaac and Zinaida (Weinlud) Rabinowitch. In 1921 Isaac Rabinowitch, a lawyer, moved his family to Berlin to escape the Russian persecution of Jews. Eugene Rabinowitch attended the University of Berlin, earning there his doctorate in chemistry in 1926. After serving as an assistant in physical chemistry at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Rabinowitch went to the University of Göttingen where he was a research associate in physics from 1929 to 1933. With the rise of the Nazi Party in the early 1930s, Jews, such as Rabinowitch, were expelled from their university posts. With the loss of his fellowship Rabinowitch was forced to leave Germany.</p><p> Rabinowitch with his wife, Anya Mejerson, whom he married on March 12, 1932, went first to Copenhagen to work with Neils Bohr at the Institute of Theoretical Physics. From here Rabinowitch moved to London to work with F. G. Donnan at University College. Rabinowitch remained in London from 1934 to 1938. It was here that his twin sons, Alexander and Victor, were born on August 30, 1934.</p><p> In 1938 Rabinowitch was invited to the United States to lecture. This resulted in the offer of a position with the Cabot Solar Energy Research Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rabinowitch was at MIT from 1939 to 1944, when James Franck, a former colleague from Göttingen, invited him to come to Chicago. In Chicago Rabinowitch joined Franck and several other distinguished scientists at what was being called the Metallurgical Laboratory. This was in reality one of the principal research centers of the Manhattan Project. Rabinowitch worked with the Project from 1944 until its completion in 1946, serving as senior chemist and section chief of the Metallurgical Laboratory's Information Division.</p><p> In June 1945 Rabinowitch and physicist Leo Szilard authored a memorandum, which became known as the Franck Report. The memorandum, which argued against the military use of the atomic bomb, was signed by seven Metallurgical Laboratory scientists led by Franck and was personally carried by Franck to the government in Washington, D. C. Although it did not persuade the United States government to refrain from use of the atomic bomb without prior demonstration of its capabilities, the Franck Report is one of the earliest statements of the Concerned Scientists Movement of the 1940s and 1950s. This Movement, which marshalled the talent and dedication of several of the scientists who had worked on the atomic bomb, was born out of the scientists' conviction that the scientific community had a right, if not a duty, to speak out on the new and complicated policy issues of the nuclear age. Joined by many colleagues who had not worked on the atomic bomb but who shared their concern, these scientists worked to educate the American public and government about the significance of atomic power. Rabinowitch was an early leader in both the Movement and the educational effort, co-founding with Hyman Goldsmith the <emph render="italic">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</emph>. As the editor-in-chief for more than twenty years Rabinowitch maintained the Bulletin's quality and independence as a forum for discussion of scientific issues with social and political implications. As such it reflected Rabinowitch's belief in the importance of keeping the scientific community informed about the impact on society of the twentieth century scientific and technological revolution in which it played a significant part.</p><p> In addition to his work on the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> and his participation in organizations of the Scientist's Movement, Rabinowitch continued to teach, to write, and to pursue his research interests in the field of photosynthesis. His seminal scientific work, <emph render="italic">Photosynthesis and Related Processes</emph>, was published in three parts between 1945 and 1956 and was supplemented by numerous articles on the topic. In 1947 Rabinowitch joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana as a research professor of botany. Helping to organize the University's Photosynthesis Research Laboratory, he then served as its director. From 1966 to 1968 he was also a member of the University's Center for Advanced Studies.</p><p> Rabinowitch's interest in public policy and political affairs was demonstrated in 1955, when he helped to organize the international forum, which became known as the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. Initiated in response to increasing world tension, the Pugwash Conferences grew out of the hopes of many distinguished scientists that war could be eliminated as an instrument of foreign policy. The Russell-Einstein Manifesto, calling for the peaceful discussion of scientific issues in an apolitical arena, sparked the convening of the first Pugwash meeting in 1957. Named for the site of the first conference, Pugwash, Nova Scotia, the international meetings provide natural and social scientists with the opportunity to discuss policy issues with their colleagues from around the world. Rabinowitch, a founder of the organization, served as a member of the International Continuing Committee of Pugwash from 1957 to 1973 and was president of the movement from 1969 to 1970.</p><p> In 1968 Rabinowitch retired from the University of Illinois and took a position with the State University of New York at Albany as professor of biology and chemistry and as senior advisor to the newly-established Center for Science and the Future of Human Affairs (later called the Center for the Study of Science and Society). Rabinowitch was the guiding force behind the new Center working to obtain funds for it and establishing goals and objectives for it. The Center was to reflect Rabinowitch's own concerns with the way in which science and technology impacted on society. Rabinowitch's son, Victor, was director of the Center from 1968 to 1970. Following Victor's resignation, Eugene Rabinowitch served as acting director from March to September 1970. Rabinowitch retired from SUNY at Albany on August 31, 1972 and was immediately reappointed as a visiting professor for the 1972/1973 school year. At this time Rabinowitch was given a leave of absence from the University in order to accept a fellowship with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institute. While in Washington, he continued to write, edit the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph>, and participate in Pugwash. Eugen I. Rabinowitch died on May 15, 1973 at Washington, D. C., at the age of seventy-two.</p><p> Books by Rabinowitch:</p><p> 1928 <emph render="italic">Rare Gases</emph></p><p> 1930 <emph render="italic">Periodic System</emph></p><p> 1945 <emph render="italic">Photosynthesis and Related Processes</emph>, Volume I</p><p> 1950 <emph render="italic">Minutes to Midnigh</emph>t, editor</p><p> 1950 <emph render="italic">Photosynthesis and Related Processes</emph>, Volume II, Part I</p><p> 1951 <emph render="italic">The Chemistry of Uranium</emph>, with J.

of the Atomic Scientists (BAS)</emph> was begun in December 1945 by Eugene Rabinowitch and Hyman H. Goldsmith. Originally called the <emph render="italic">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago</emph>, it served as a newsletter for the Atomic Scientists of Chicago. In 1946 the name was changed to its present form. <emph render="italic">The Bulletin</emph> started "as a means of calling public attention to the perils of atomic energy and the urgent need for its control by a civilian agency". The <emph render="italic">BAS</emph> evolved into a forum for scientists concerned about science policy and the relationship of science to national and international affairs. It covers topics ranging from genetics to pollution to space exploration. Rabinowitch and Goldsmith co-edited the journal until the latter's death in August 1949. From 1949 until his own death in 1973, Rabinowitch was editor-in-chief of the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph>. <emph render="italic">BAS</emph> continues to be published ten times a year under the auspices of the Educational Foundation of Nuclear Science, Inc. <emph render="italic">The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</emph>, 1945-1972, files are organized into three sections as listed and described below. Material within the sections is arranged chronologically by year, month, and day. Partially dated material is placed at the end of the month or year; undated items are placed after dated material.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_eb2404ad720887e851cbdba2dad6901d" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>2.1</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1945/1972" type="inclusive">1945-1972</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_84fd34b524f15dbd911be6601e79f937"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Correspondence dates primarily from 1964 to 1972.

id="aspace_4662be51f31200a2ee0c6fcf3d94e3ae"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Conferences on Science and World Affairs, otherwise known as Pugwash, "is a union of scientists who are concerned about the relations between science and society". Stated simply by Joseph Rotblat, secretary general of the movement, the aim of Pugwash is "to ensure that mankind will not destroy itself. Rabinowitch had an early influence in establishing the Pugwash Movement. In 1954 he opened discussions with Joseph Rotblat of Great Britain's Atomic Scientists' Association, which led to the 1955 International Conference on Science and Society. This conference endorsed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto which had been published shortly before. The Manifesto called for a conference of scientists to review the dangers of nuclear war and discuss means of achieving international understanding. This was fulfilled in the meeting of scientists in July 1957 at Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The name of the site became the name of the movement - Pugwash. The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, 1957-1972, consist of a small, fragmentary amount of material dating primarily from the 1960s. The files are arranged in four categories-correspondence, conferences, symposia, and clippings. The conferences are arranged by date of meeting; the symposia are arranged alphabetically by title of meeting. Material within the files is arranged chronologically by year, month, and day. Partially dated items are placed at the end of the month or year; undated items are placed after dated material. Enclosures are placed after their letter of transmittal.</p><p> Rabinowitch attended this first conference and was selected to serve on the Continuing Committee whose purpose was to organize future meetings. Rabinowitch remained a member of the Committee until just prior to his death in 1973. Throughout his life Rabinowitch was active in the Pugwash Movement, attending every conference and serving as president of the 1970 conference held at Fontana, Wisconsin. The files consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence, minutes, agenda, reports, financial statements, conference papers, participant lists, and clippings. The correspondence chiefly concerns planning for the various Pugwash conferences. Among the correspondents are Cyrus S. Eaton, who provided the financial backing of the early conferences; Joseph Rotblat, the first secretary general of Pugwash; and Bertrand Russell, who was one of the initiators of the Pugwash Movement. There are small amounts of material concerning eight of the international Pugwash conferences. Of interest among this material is a statement drafted by Rabinowitch for the 1962 conference in London.</p><p> During Rabinowitch's lifetime the following conferences were held:</p><p> First Conference: Pugwash, Nova Scotia, July 7-10, 1957.</p><p> Second Conference: Lac Beauport, France, March 31 - April 11, 1958, "The Dangers of the Present Situation, and Ways and Means of Diminishing

The files are arranged alphabetically by title of the conference. Items within the files are arranged chronologically by year, month, and day. Partially dated items are placed at the end of the month or year; undated items are placed after dated material. The files contain correspondence, reports, conference papers, programs, agenda, lecture notes, participant lists, receipts, vouchers, pamphlets, and leaflets. The files represent conferences, which Rabinowitch attended or presented a paper. There are also files concerning conferences to which Rabinowitch was invited but was unable to attend. A number of the conferences reflect Rabinowitch's interests in photosynthesis and photochemistry. Other conferences concern his work in international affairs, such as the Hiroshima Conference.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f00d223f33a3b2a8882e86f35a0c9f6e"

The files are arranged alphabetically by author's, name and then by title. The files contain correspondence, drafts of manuscripts, reprints, pamphlets, and radio broadcasts. An attempt was made to include in this-part unpublished manuscripts or material that would not be readily available from other sources. The manuscripts include documents, which Rabinowitch may have collected because of his specific interest in science or international affairs. Or the manuscripts may have been sent to Rabinowitch by the authors for his review and comment. The writings cover a wide range of topics including nuclear energy, disarmament, population control, chemistry, international politics, and scientific education. Of special interest are the scripts of radio broadcasts entitled "The Fifth Horseman". Broadcast in 1946, this Series was designed to educate the American public about the atomic bomb and the results of its use.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_0528a8baf6c082b1d42dbddfde27cdec" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alfven et al., M-70 (untitled)</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1923/1973" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_00a473fe16e44eb6803129aa81efd622" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">6 (5-Writings)</container><container id="aspace_a000e43d0b9ea723974f2cf4f85583c4" parent="aspace_00a473fe16e44eb6803129aa81efd622" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_962da6240d7ec3f6a581f6a14b56c82d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Artsimovitch, L.

The researcher should note that the tape recordings are of very poor quality. Material has been recorded at various speeds on the same tape.
