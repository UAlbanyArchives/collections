    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Richard Plant (1910-1998) was born Richard Plaut in Frankfort, Germany. He was a gay and Jewish author and educator who emigrated first to Switzerland in 1933 and then to the United States of America in 1938. Plant was encouraged to flee Nazi persecution by his father, who was a Jewish Socialist. In 1935, he was awarded a Ph.D. in languages from the University of Basel in Switzerland. </p><p>It was during his time in Basel that he wrote the children's book Die Kiste mit dem großen S (1936) as well as several film reviews for Basel's National-Zeitung and even wrote articles under the pseudonym "Richard Plant" in Nazi, Germany. Plant's dissertation the sexual and psychological aspects of the narrative style of Austrian Jewish physician and author Arthur Schnitzler. His next book "Taschenbuch des Films" (1938) was a nonfiction study and analysis of international films. </p><p>After graduation, Plant emigrated to New York City and formally Americanized his name to "Richard Rene Plant" and began communicating with other emigres via the left-wing German Jewish weekly Aufbau.  After America entered World War II, Plant found employment for three years as a propaganda scriptwriter, translator, and broadcaster for the U.S. Office of War Information and for NBC. He became a naturalized citizen on January 29, 1945. In 1947 he was hired by the City College of the City University of New York. One year later he published his highly autobiographical novel The Dragon in the Forest (1948). Plant would also review books, primarily current German literature and was granted tenure in 1957 and promotion to full professor in 1970.</p><p>Notably, Plant wrote the scenario for the opera Lizzie Borden which premiered in 1965. Following his retirement in 1973, he began to devote more of his time to gay activism and began writing a history of the persecution of gay men under Nazi regime. The forward and conclusion are both autobiographical, and his research included traveling to Arolsen, German to review the records of the concentration camp archives. His magnum opus was The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals, published in 1986. Plant died in New York City in 1998.</p>  </bioghist>
