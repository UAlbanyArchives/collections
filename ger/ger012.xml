    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Benedikt Fred Dolbin was born on August 1, 1883 in Vienna, Austria. He was a painter, writer, illustrator, and cartoonist. He had been trained and qualified as an engineer but decided against it and went on to study composition. In Vienna, in the early 1920s, he studied musical composition with Arnold SchÃ¶nberg and art with Egon Schiele. Dolbin taught himself how to draw and would produce portraits of famous poets. He served as a journalist in Berlin in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He was also a cartoonist for the Berliner Tageblatt newspaper. After the Nazis took power, Dolbin was not able to continue his work because he was Jewish. He emigrated to the United States in 1935.</p><p>He died on March 31, 1971 in Jackson Heights, New York.</p>  </bioghist>
