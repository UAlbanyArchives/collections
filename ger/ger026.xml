<p>Wolfram Eberhard was born in Potsdam Germany on March 17, 1909 to Gustav B. and Gertrud Mueller Eberhard. Eberhard went to Berlin University to study Chinese and social anthropology. Wanting more education on China, Eberhard secretly enrolled at the Seminar for Oriental Languages because his professors at Berlin did not believe in teaching colloquial languages. After school, Eberhard worked at the Berlin Anthropological Museum and traveled to China in 1934. </p><p>While on his trip to China, Eberhard taught at Peking National University, Peiping Municipal University, and the Medical School at Baoding. Eberhard wrote and published books about China and language throughout this trip. After returning to Germany in 1936, Eberhard became the director of Asian studies at the Grassi Museum in Leipzig. At the height of the War, Eberhard was able to get a Moses Mendelssohn Fellowship and left for Hong-Kong, China where he then went to Turkey and began teaching history at Ankara University. While working at this University, he continued to publish works. </p><p>Eberhard received a one-year Rockefeller grant at the University of California, Berkeley in 1948 and ended up being offered a full-time faculty position in the Department of Sociology where he taught until 1976. </p><p>Throughout his career, Eberhard published extenisvely.  He published some 35 books, 185 articles, 300 book reviews, and numerous shorter notes in Chinese, German, Turkish, and English.  </p><p>Eberhard died on August 15, 1989 and was survived by his wife and two children. </p>  </bioghist>
