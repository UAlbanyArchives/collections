    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, Klaus Liepmann (1907-1990) first began studying the violin as a young child and later the viola and piano as well. He studied ensemble playing at the Hamburg Conservatory of Music. Liepmann continued his studies for five more years at the Academy of Music in Cologne, then in 1931 he became concertmaster of the Berlin University Orchestra and eirector of Hamburg University concerts.</p><p>As a Jewish person, Liepmann was deprived from performing when the Nazis came to power in Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1933. He initially took positions in the New York City school system, then studied at Yale University. From 1939 to 1944 he directed the Yale Symphony Orchestra. During the final part of World War II, Liepmann was music advisor of the Army's First Service Command, supervising music education and recreation in all Army camps and hospitals in New England.</p><p>Liepmann became the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's first full-time professor of music in 1947 and remained at the school until his retirement in 1972. He was considered the "Father of Music" at M.I.T. He was the first to bring music to the humanities department there and became the first full-time director of music and conductor of the M.I.T. choral society and orchestra.  </p>  </bioghist>
