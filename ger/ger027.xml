    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Gunter Anders was born July 12, 1902, in Breslau, Poland (now Wroclaw, Poland). His parents were child psychologists Clara and William Stern. Anders was married three times to Hannah Arendt (1929-1937), a political scientist, Elisabeth Freundlich (1945-1955), an Austrian writer, and his last wife, Charlotte Lois Zelka (1957-death) an American pianist.</p><p>Anders was a journalist in Berlin. An editor for one of the newspapers he wrote for didn't want too many "Jewish-sounding" names in his papers. As Anders's birth name was Gunther Stern, he chose the name "Anders." He used this name for the rest of his life. During the Nazi years, Gunther Anders lived and wrote in California and New York, where he taught at the New School for Social Research; after the war, he returned to Vienna with his wife Charlotte, a concert pianist. </p><p>Anders wrote a philosophical book entitled <emph render="italic">The Obsolescence of Humankind</emph> (1956) becoming a leader in the anti-nuclear movement. After this, he proceeded to publish many more essays about this topic. He wrote on German literature, the threat of nuclear war, and ethical questions.</p>  </bioghist>
