<p>Born in 1902, Felix Hirsch was a native of Berlin, Germany. He received a Ph.D. in history from Heidelberg University in 1923. Hirsch was editor of various German newspapers before he came to the United States in 1935. He earned a degree in library science from Columbia University and became a librarian at Bard College at Annandale-on-Hudson, NY in 1936. He also served as a professor of history at Bard until 1954. In 1955, he became librarian and professor of history at Trenton State College in New Jersey, retiring in 1972.</p>
