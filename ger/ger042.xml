Felix Hirsch, a native of Berlin, Germany, was editor of various German newspapers before he came to the United States in 1935. He earned a degree in library science from Columbia University and became a librarian at Bard College at Annandale-on-Hudson, NY in 1936. He also served as a professor of history at Bard until 1954. In 1955, he became librarian and professor of history at Trenton State College in New Jersey, retiring in 1972.

 <p>He died in December 1982 at the age of 80, survived by his wife, the former Elisabeth Fesit, two sons and four grandchildren.</p>
 
<p>Elisabeth (Fesit) Hirsch was born in 1904 in Mainz, Germany, but grew up in Berlin.  She received her Ph.D. in Philosophy and History from the University of Marburg, immigrated to the United States in 1938, and married Felix that same year.  After raising their two sons, she began teaching at Bard College and, beginning in 1956, was Professor of Philosophy and Modern Languages at Trenton State College.</p>
