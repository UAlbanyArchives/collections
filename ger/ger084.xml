      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>During his lifetime Hans Speier was distinguished by two very distinct careers. Speier was a lecturer in political sociology and economics in Germany (1931-1933) before emigrating to the U.S. to accept a position as lecturer and professor of political sociology on the newly formed Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York (1933-1942, 1947-1948), lecturing summers at the University of Illinois (1941) and the University of Michigan (1941). Speier interrupted his university career for one in government service and research, but returned to teaching in 1969 at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (1969-1973), where he held the title of Robert M. MacIver Professor of Sociology and Government.</p>
      <p> Between 1942 and 1948, Speier served in the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service of the Federal Communications Commission (later Chief of the Central European Section), advisor on propaganda policy to the Director of the Overseas Branch, Office of War Information, and eventually became Associate Chief of the State Department's Occupied Areas Division. In 1948, Speier joined the staff of The Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California, first serving as the Organizer and Head of the Social Science Division from 1948 to 1960, later becoming a member of the Rand Research Council from 1960-1968.</p>
      <p> Speier's research interests focus on the political implications of military affairs and the influence of military power on the behavior of governments in the conduct of his foreign policies. He authored or co-edited numerous books and articles on these subjects, including <emph render="italic">German Radio Propaganda</emph> (with Ernst Kris, 1944), <emph render="italic">Social Order and the Risks of War</emph> (1952), <emph render="italic">West German Leadership and Foreign Policy</emph> (with W. Davison, 1957), <emph render="italic">German Rearmament and Atomic War</emph> (1957), <emph render="italic">Divided Berlin: The Anatomy of Soviet Political Blackmail</emph> (1961), <emph render="italic">Die Angestellten vor dem Nationalsozialismus</emph> (1977; English title: <emph render="italic">German White Collar Workers and the Rise of Hitler</emph>), and <emph render="italic">Propaganda and Communication in World History</emph> (co-edited with Harold Lasswell and Daniel Lerner, 3 vols., 1979-1980). He also published his translation of Grimmelshausen's <emph render="italic">Courage, the Adventuress and the False Messiah</emph> (1964), as well his autobiographical account, <emph render="italic">From the Ashes of Disgrace: A Journal from Germany 1945-1955</emph> (1981).</p>
      <p> Speier was married twice, first in 1929 to Lisa (Luise) Griesbach, with whom he had two children, Sybil D. and Steven W. Lisa Speier died in 1965 and Speier married his second wife Margit in February 1967. Hans Speier, the last surviving member of the famed Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, died at the age of 85 on February 17, 1990 while vacationing in Sarasota, Florida.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Hans Speier Papers, 1922-1989, primarily focus on Speier's career in the United States after his emigration to the United States in 1933. A small number of documents for both Speier and his wife, Lisa Griesbach Speier, date from the pre-U.S. period, 1922-1933. Early materials are in German, with post-1933 materials predominately in English.</p>
      <p> The collection is divided into 10 series: 1) Biographical materials, including family documents and correspondence, 1922-1984; 2) Autobiographical writings, 1945-1989; 3) Correspondence files, 1911-1988; 4) Manuscripts and typescripts, ca. 1920-1987; 5) The RAND Corporation materials, 1948-1988; Miscellaneous typescripts by other authors, 1941-1982; 6) Miscellaneous typescripts by other authors, 1941-1982; 7) Nazi propaganda, 1941-1944; Anti-Nazi propaganda, 1943-1944; Allied Forces Intelligence Reports and memoranda, 1940-1948; 8) Notes and materials on various topics; and 9) Note cards;and 10) Political pamphlets, 1934-1970. Series 4 is further divided into two sub-series: typescripts of books written or edited by Speier, and typescripts of shorter writings, including poetry, short stories and essayistic writings. Series 5 is also divided into two sub-series: Hans Speier's log notes (diary entries) and the essayistic writings.</p>
      <p> The correspondence files contain correspondence with colleagues and leading scholars of the day, including Max Ascoli, Reinhard Bendix, Arvid Brodersen, Lewis A. Coser, Alexander George, Herbert Goldhamer, Joseph Goldsen, Fred C. Iklé, Alvin Johnson, Paul Kecskemeti, Henry J. Kellermann, Ernst Kris, Nathan Leites, M. Rainer Lepsius, Hans Staudinger and Leo Strauss. Also represented in the collection is a lengthy correspondence with co-editors of the three-volume work <emph render="italic">Propaganda and Communication in World History</emph> Harold Lasswell and Daniel Lerner, as well as correspondence with individual contributors to the volumes.</p>
      <p> Two additional series should be noted: The RAND Corporation materials (Series 5) and the Nazi propaganda and anti-Nazi propaganda and intelligence materials (Series 7). The RAND Corporation materials span four decades and document Speier's important career as organizer and Head of the Social Science Division of the RAND Corporation from 1948-1960 and a member of the RAND Research Council from 1960-1968. During those years he wrote and directed numerous studies for RAND and the texts of many of the position papers, memoranda, lecture texts and essays are present in the collection. Included in the Nazi and anti-Nazi propaganda materials is a collection of rare leaflets prepared by the Psychological Warfare Branch of the U.S. Army and disseminated to enemy troops in Italy in 1943-1944.</p>
      <p> In addition to the numerous texts written by Speier during his years at The RAND Corporation, the collection also contains numerous texts of essays, as well as typescript and manuscript versions of books, in particular the monograph <emph render="italic">Die Angestellten vor dem Nationalsozialismus</emph> (1977) and his autobiographical work <emph render="italic">From the Ashes of Disgrace: A Journal from Germany, 1945-1955</emph>.</p>

          <p>This series contains the autobiographical writings of Hans Speier and also includes transcripts of two interviews. Of particular interest are the typescripts of his published autobiography, From the Ashes of Disgrace: A Journal from Germany 1945-1955. The early versions of many of the typescript sections were taken from Speier's log notes for his trips to Germany for the Rand Corporation in the 1950s. (The complete log notes are located in Series 5: The Rand Corporation materials.).</p>
