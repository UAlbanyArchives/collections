    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Born in Berlin, Manfred George emigrated  from Germany after the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany.  Upon his arrival in the United States, George became editor-in-chief of the German-language newspaper <i>Aufbau</i>, a position he held from 1939 until his death in 1965.  Under George's direction, <i>Aufbau</i> morphed from a monthly newsletter into a weekly publication.</p>  </bioghist>
