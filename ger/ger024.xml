    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Arnold Brecht was born in 1884 in Lübeck, Germany. After completing his university studies in Bonn, Berlin, Göttingen and Leipzig, he received his Doctor of Law degree from Leipzig in 1906. In 1910, Brecht's career turned to civil service. From 1910 to 1933, he served under seven Reich Chancellors and more than a dozen Reich and Prussian ministers, until he was formally dismissed from his position as acting state secretary by Hitler in 1933.</p><p> Upon the invitation of Alvin Johnson, Brecht emigrated to the U.S. in 1933 to become one of the initial members of the newly formed "University in Exile", the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science of the New School for Social Research in New York City. Brecht remained on the Faculty of the New School until his retirement in 1954, after which he continued to lecture as an Emeritus Professor of Political Science and Jurisprudence until 1963.</p><p> In addition to his teaching and lecturing, Brecht was also called upon to advise the United States Military (OMGUS - Office of Military Government for Germany) in the rebuilding of Germany after World War II, as well as serving as an Expert to the Secretary of the Army, and a lecturer in the Army Specialized Training Programs at City College, Harvard and Haverford Colleges.</p><p> Arnold Brecht's publications, dating from his law school years, encompass the areas of civil law, international relations, political science and theory, and political, constitutional and administrative problems of his day. His best-known work, <emph render="italic">Political Theory. The Foundations of Twentieth Century Political Thought</emph>, has been reprinted several times as well as translated into German, Portuguese and Spanish. Brecht's rich and influential life and career are detailed in his memoirs, published first in German in two volumes (<emph render="italic">Aus nächster Nähe</emph> and <emph render="italic">Mit der Kraft des Geistes</emph>) in 1966 and 1967 respectively, and later condensed and released in an English edition under the title <emph render="italic">The Political Education of Arnold Brecht</emph> in 1970. Brecht died while on a visit to Germany on September 11, 1977.</p>    <chronlist>

1933-1976. The correspondence has been arranged alphabetically within several categories: family, professional and general, students, politicians and public officials (U.S. and Germany), administrative and faculty members of the New School for Social Research, and organizational correspondence. The professional and general correspondence includes substantial amounts between Brecht and Julie Braun-Vogelstein, Jürgen Fehling, Carl Joachim (Achim) Friedrich, Kurt von Fritz, Ernest Hamburger, Ernest Hocking, Fritz Morstein-Marx and Gustav and Lydia Radbruch, as well as with former students Morris Forkosch and Alfred J. Jung. The collection also contains correspondence with the American statesman John Foster Dulles, as well as lengthy exchanges with German statesmen Otto Braun, Heinrich Brüning, Ferdinand Friedensburg and Theodor Heuss. The series also contains Brecht's correspondence with other members of the New School for Social Research, most notably with former New School Deans Alvin Johnson, Hans Simons and Hans Staudinger.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_2145cae9270cffe4a250bd505a464fb8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_97b7859a193687b8163dfb7ba0cced76" level="otherlevel"><did><unittitle>Family members</unittitle><unitid>2.1</unitid></did><c id="aspace_4ed5405c369161b4d8d5ae0ecdec8fe8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Barthels, Dorothea (niece)</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1966/1966" type="inclusive">1966</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc8b7351b6c5aeb163291c9b34d623dd" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3 (2-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_4cc3377e1a6decd12044ecef09481939" parent="aspace_bc8b7351b6c5aeb163291c9b34d623dd" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_36e55bf007898d191d8282495d3333eb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brecht, Marie (née Weishaupt, mother)</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1909/1909" type="inclusive">1909</unitdate><container id="aspace_e78d1a2fb18483170a03106728b4e710" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3 (2-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_ae39b8a64d549d640487da4fd70b2d42" parent="aspace_e78d1a2fb18483170a03106728b4e710" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_59ee69e36e19a150657b985f9887dd84" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brecht, Gustav (brother)</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1909/1909" type="inclusive">1909</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1945/1948" type="inclusive">1945-1948</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1955/1958" type="inclusive">1955-1958</unitdate><container id="aspace_ed26e56b2b19d473e8eb535d3ed6f58e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">3 (2-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_d5e0d4328f68a5cf880b79fb4629de0b" parent="aspace_ed26e56b2b19d473e8eb535d3ed6f58e" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b18d44a13f10a48e8db69f1715ee3123" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brecht, Gustav.
