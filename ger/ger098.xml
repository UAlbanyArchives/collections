    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Kurt Wolff (1912-2003) was a sociologist who taught first at Ohio State University and then at Brandeis University.  He began his studies at the University of Frankfurt in Germany during the early 1930s, but his work was interrupted by the Nazis' rise to power. After moving to to Italy, he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1935. Four years later, anti-Semitic laws again forced Wolff to leave and, in 1939, he relocated to the United States where he began his teaching and research career.</p>  </bioghist>
