      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Death Penalty in New York Testimony Collection was collected as part of a partnership 
	  between the Capital Punishment Research Initiative (CPRI) at the University at Albany's School 
	  of Criminal Justice and the University at Albany Libraries. The CPRI, headed by Professors James 
	  Acker and Charles Lanier, donated this material in an effort to provide researchers with full 
	  coverage of the hearings.</p>
      <p>As explained in <emph render="italic">Death Penalty in New York, A Report on Five Public Hearings</emph> 
	  (pages 1-4), the New York State Assembly Standing Committees on Codes, Judiciary and Correction held 
	  a succession of public hearings in December 2004 through February 2005 on the death penalty in New York in 
	  reaction to the June 24, 2004, decision by the New York Court of Appeals to strike down the New 
	  York's capital punishment law enacted in 1995. The decision, rendered in People v. LaValle, 
	  struck down New York's "deadlock" instruction provision, which had been proposed by Governor 
	  Pataki and passed by the New York State Senate in 1995. The "deadlock" instruction provision 
	  ordered juries to be instructed that they give one of only two sentencing options, death or 
	  life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and that they be further instructed that 
	  in the event of a jury deadlock that the defendant would be sentenced to a minimum of 20-25 
	  year and a maximum of life imprisonment. It was the decision that jurors might feel coerced 
	  into choosing the death penalty to avoid the court deciding to give a defendant a minimum 20-25 
	  year sentence.</p>
      <p>When the New York Court of Appeals struck down the "deadlock" provision it completely forbade 
	  the operation of the death penalty. However, the Court did agree that life without the possibility 
	  of parole was a fair alternative sentence. The decision by the New York Court of Appeals left the 
	  New York State Assembly the charge to enact legislation that would reinstate the death penalty, 
	  modify the death penalty, or abolish the death penalty. The committees acknowledged that the death 
	  penalty in New York had been ineffective. The committees recognized that in the ten years since the 
	  law was enacted more than $170 million had been spent in pursuit of death penalty cases, yet no one 
	  was executed. In total, four sentences were struck down by the New York Court of Appeals, one 
	  sentence was converted to life without parole, and two cases were still in the sentencing process. 
	  The committees noted that numerous death row exonerations due to DNA testing had been occurring in 
	  the previous ten years and also observed a change in public opinion. The New York State Assembly 
	  Standing Committees on Codes, Judiciary and Correction decided that it would formally review New 
	  York's death penalty law including its history, the needs of defendants, and the wishes of constituents.</p>
      <p>The committees heard oral testimony from 146 witnesses and read written testimony from another 
	  24 witnesses, both of which combined to more than 4,000 transcribed pages. The documents in this 
	  collection, however, do not give an indication of the New York State Assembly Standing Committees 
	  on Codes, Judiciary and Correction's final decision about capital punishment in New York State. 
	  However, the Death Penalty Information Center (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org) indicates that the 
	  Assembly did vote to eliminate the death penalty on April 12, 2005. To read the text of Bill A00851, 
	  which repeals the death penalty in New York State, see the laws on the New York State Assembly's web 
	  site (http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Death Penalty in New York Testimony Collection includes testimony given to the New York 
	  State Assembly Standing Committee on Codes, Assembly Standing Committee on Judiciary, and Assembly 
	  Standing Committee on Correction, on December 14, 2004, January 21 and 25, 2005, and February 8 
	  and 11, 2005. The collection includes testimony from 137 witnesses, including officials from grass 
	  roots organizations, practicing lawyers, law professors, concerned citizens, religious leaders, 
	  former inmates, and families of victims. The collection also includes the Public Hearing reports 
	  for each day of hearings, recorded verbatim; a copy of the 1965 Committee for the Revision of the 
	  Penal and Criminal Legal Code Special Report on Capital Punishment; and an amicus brief ("friend 
	  of the court"), People v. McCoy, filed by Stewart F. Hancock.</p>
      <p>This collection lacks biographical information about most of the witnesses, as well as the New 
	  York Assembly Committee members. It also lacks a comprehensive timeline for the final decision of 
	  the New York State Assembly Committee.</p>
      <p>Related collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives can 
	  be found in the subject guides for the National Death Penalty Archive and Criminal Justice and Prisons.</p>

          <p>This series includes the reports from each hearing day, published by the New York 
		  Assembly Standing Committee on Codes, Assembly Standing Committee on Judiciary, and 
		  Assembly Standing Committee on Correction. The final reports, compiled from the 
		  proceedings of all five days of testimony, are also included. The series also includes 
		  two amicus briefs, People v. McCoy and People v. Cahill, filed by Stewart F. Hancock. 
		  An amicus brief, a brief filed by "a friend of the court," is filed to advise the court 
		  in its consideration of the case. Hancock is a retired Justice of the New York State 
		  Court of Appeals and was asked by the group People Against the Death Penalty, Central 
		  New York, to file an amicus brief for consideration by the New York Court of Appeals 
		  using the cases of the People v. Cahill and People v. McCoy to demonstrate support for 
		  commuting death sentences to life without parole.</p>
          <p>This series also includes a published booklet by the Capital Punishment Committee 
		  of Michigan about the New York hearings, entitled <emph render="italic">A Guide to 
		  the New York Death Penalty Hearings, 2004-2005</emph>. This booklet, which lists witness 
		  names, was written by Eugene G. Wanger, who also testified. Finally, also in this series 
		  is the 1965 <emph render="italic">Committee for the Revision of the Penal and Criminal 
		  Legal Code Special Report on Capital Punishment</emph>.</p>
