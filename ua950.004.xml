      <p>The University at Albany has been publishing varied array of materials related to school, student, and faculty functions for some time. At times the Univeristy is directly publishign these materials, but more often than not these pieces were created by students and faculty of the institution. These materials includeed academic journals and newsletters from individual departments such as the anthropology and criminal justice dpeartments. many of these publications did nto have long runs and so only encompass a few years. The university continues to support publications from faculty and students and will continue to grow in volume.</p>
