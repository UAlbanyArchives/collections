      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Correctional Association of New York was founded in 1844 by John W. Edmonds, President
        of the Board of Inspectors at Sing Sing Prison [Unless otherwise noted, all information is
        taken from <emph render="italic">The Correctional Association of New York, A History:
          1844-1989</emph>]. Originally named the Prison Association of New York, the organization
        was formed to ameliorate the conditions of criminal defendants and prisoners, improve the
        discipline and administration of local jails and state prisons, and furnish assistance and
        encouragement to reformed convicts after discharge. It is the only private organization in
        the state that has the power to conduct on-site examinations of state and local correctional
        facilities and report its findings and recommendations to governmental authorities ["The
        Correctional Association of New York: A Public Interest Criminal Justice Membership
        Organization", in Resources Committee-Cocktail Part, 1982, folder, in Series 1, Board of
        Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>Since 1846, it has been charged with submitting an annual report on prison conditions in
        New York State to the New York State Assembly.</p>
      <p>The Association has always furnished aid to male and female prisoners. However, roughly a
        decade after its foundation a number of members became convinced that the special needs of
        female offenders were not being addressed. Led by Issac G. Hopper, the chair of the
        Association's Female Department, they left the Association and formed their own group, the
        Women's Prison Association of New York ["Draft-Scope of the Association's Activities", circa
        1975, in Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1, Board of Directors
        Files, 1942-88. For more information about this organization, see: Women's Prison
        Association and Home, 150 Years in the Forefront: The Women's Prison Association and Home
        (1995). Available [online]:
        http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/chronicl/wpa/html/wpaopen.htm [13 April 2000]].</p>
      <p>During the nineteenth century, the organization took a leading role in prison reform in the
        United States and the world. It formed the National Prison Association (now the American
        Prison Association), a nationwide umbrella organization, in 1870. Two years later, it
        started the International Prison Congress, a world-wide gathering of prison officials and
        social reformers that met every five years. The League of Nations eventually assumed
        responsibility for running the conferences, which are now held under the auspices of the
        United Nations.</p>
      <p>The Association was active in promoting numerous criminal justice system reforms in New
        York State. The organization was instrumental in creating New York State's first probation
        and parole systems (c.1875) and pressed for the creation of separate facilities for youthful
        offenders (1864-74) and a separate juvenile justice system (1874-1904) ["A Brief Description
        of the Correctional Association's Purpose, History, Recent Publications, Current Program",
        in Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1, Board of Directors Files,
        1942-88, and untitled typescript notes beginning with "Parole/Probation", in Correctional
        Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1, Board of Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>The Association sought to ensure that prisoners had opportunities to acquire formal
        education and advocated the creation of prison libaries (1904-24). It also fought to ensure
        that prisoners could learn a trade while incarcerated and that their labor was not
        exploited. Other policies the Association advocated included: a prison classification
        system; opposition to corporal punishment (1844-64); the Presidential Commutation Act;
        special care facilities for inmates afflicted with tuberculosis; establishment of a
        psychiatric clinic at Sing Sing Prison; creation of the New York City Parole Commission;
        establishment of prison libraries (1904-24); development of policies which enabled prisoners
        to contribute to the war effort by working in war-related industries (1940-42);
        establishment of a Crime Victims Compensation Board (1965-66); creation of an adequate
        public defender system [. The Prison Association of New York, One Hundred Years of Faithful
        Service, 1844-1944 (New York: The Prison Association of New York, 1944), 3-7. A copy of this
        publication is housed in the Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder, in Series 1,
        Board of Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the organization advocated the establishment of a Crime Victims
        Compensation Board (1965-66) and pressed for the decriminalization of pornography, sexual
        acts between consenting adults, and other crimes it deemed "victimless" ["Draft-Scope of the
        Association's Activities", circa 1975, in Correctional Association History, 1955-83, folder,
        in Series 1, Board of Directors Files, 1942-88].</p>
      <p>Recent activities of the Association include the AIDS in Prison Project, the Public Policy
        Project, the Prison Overcrowding Project, the Prison and Jail Conditions Project, and the
        Prison Visiting Committee (1980-present). The Association has also been active in efforts to
        educate the public about the immense costs incurred by city, county, and state correctional
        agencies and to promote alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders ["The
        Correctional Association of New York: A Public Interest Criminal Justice Membership
        Organization"].</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Series 1 contains the Board of Directors Files, roughly between 1942 and 1986. This series
        consists of correspondence, meeting minutes of the Board of Directors (1977-85) and the
        Executive Committee (1971-73, 1984), and committee files created or gathered by the
        executive director, chairman, president, general secretary, and committee chairs of the
        Association. It also contains biographical information about prospective board members
        gathered by the Nominating Committee (1963-67, 1969, 1971-72, 1974-82, 1984). Other
        documents in the series include meeting agendas, memoranda, grant proposals, reports,
        membership statistics, and records concerning bequests and endowments made to the
        Association. This material concerns prison conditions, children of offenders, sentencing
        policies, court rulings concerning prisoners' efforts to form labor unions, construction of
        new correctional facilities, and the operations of the Association itself. Letters from
        inmates concerning living conditions in various correctional facilities, transfers from one
        facility to another, health issues, allegations of abuse by corrections officers, and
        post-release work arrangements and drug-rehabilitation programs are scattered throughout the
        series. One of the letters (1985) directed to Correctional Association President Robert
        Gangi was written by Jean Harris, who became interested in the special problems of female
        inmates and their children during her imprisonment for murder. Note that the files created
        by the Institution's Visiting Committee are housed in Series 3, Prison Visits Files, circa
        1915-85, and files created by the Narcotics Committee are housed in Series 4, Narcotics
        Committee Files, 1949-75.</p>
      <p>Series 2 contains annual reports from 1846-1979 on 11 reels of 35 mm microfilm in the
        University Library's Microfilm Collection (Call No. HV 8987 P684). This series consists
        exclusively of the printed annual reports on prison and jail conditions that the Prison
        Association/Correctional Association submitted to the New York State Assembly. The reports
        contain minutes of meetings, presidential addresses, committee reports, reports on
        individual prisons and prison conditions, prison reform campaigns in New York State,
        transcripts of testimony before the NYS legislature on pending policy measures, and lists of
        members and corresponding members of the Association. Reports published during the latter
        half of the nineteenth century chronicled the Association's role in establishing national
        and international prison reform organizations and conferences and furnished information
        about prison policies elsewhere in the United States and the world. Bound copies of the
        1867-1878 and 1921-1969 Annual Reports are also available in the M.E. Grenander Department
        of Special Collections and Archives.</p>
      <p>Prison Visits Files (circa 1915, 1962, 1974-85) may be found in Series 3. This series
        consists of material generated in connection with the Correctional Association's statutory
        responsibility for inspecting jails, prisons, and adolescent detention facilities in New
        York State. Documents in this series were created by the Association's General Secretary,
        Institution's Visiting Committee, and other personnel. The series includes correspondence,
        prison visit reports, prison tour requests, memoranda, affidavits, and various court
        records. Also included is records concerning Correctional Association President Adam
        McQuillan's 1977 visit to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility. The only document from
        circa 1915 is a pamphlet describing a traveling exhibition about the New York State prison
        system.</p>
      <p>Series 4 is the Narcotics Committee Files, (1949, 1962-72, 1975). This series was created
        by the Association's Narcotics Committee, which apparently kept its records separate from
        other material generated by members of the Board of Directors. It contains reports,
        pamphlets, articles, brochures, memoranda, news clippings, and some correspondence. Among
        the subjects covered are: the New York State Narcotics Addiction Control Commission, drug
        rehabilitation programs, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, and methadone maintenance
        programs.</p>
      <p>Program and Bureau Files from 1967-83 are in Series 5. This series contains material
        created or collected by Correctional Association staffers responsible for operating programs
        that furnished direct services to inmates and their families. The Association's Family
        Services Bureau, Legal Services Bureau, and Social Services Bureau were long-term programs
        that were phased out during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Programs established during the
        1980s were grant-funded demonstration projects designed to encourage emulation; the
        Association did not have the financial resources needed to sustain long-term social service
        programs. Of interest particular interest was the Association's short-term program to
        furnish counseling services to young offenders sent to the Adolescent Reception and
        Detention Center on Riker's Island (1981-82). Also of interest are the documents generated
        in connection with the Association's efforts to establish an Ombudsman Program (1972-73) and
        the ensuing resistance of Governor Nelson Rockefeller and state correction officials to such
        a program.</p>
      <p>Project Files from 1974-88 are found in Series 6. This series consists of material created
        or collected by Correctional Association staffers and board members engaged in short-term
        projects designed to produce written reports about various aspects of the correctional
        system; copies of many of these reports are included. Of particular interest are the Case
        Histories Project (1983-85), Idle Time Project (1981-85), and the Prison and Jail Conditions
        Project (1982-86), which entailed extensive surveys of conditions and inmate programs
        available in New York State correctional facilities and generated correspondence and other
        material from inmates. Also of note is the Prison Mental Hygiene Project (1985-88) that
        documents the programs and resources then available to prisoners with mental illness and
        developmental disabilities. Two of the projects, the State Planning Project (1981-82) and
        the Prison Overcrowding Project (1982-84), concern crowding in prisons and alternatives to
        new prison construction. This series also contains material generated in connection with the
        AIDS in Prison Project (1985-88), the Budget Education Project (1983-85), the Latino Project
        (1985-88), and proposals for several other projects that the Association did not complete.
        Please note that all material that contains inmates' names and other identifying information
        is restricted.</p>
      <p>Series 7 contains subject files from 1947-88, but the majority of files are from 1970-85.
        This series consists of a wide array of material concerning correctional facility
        operations, criminal law and the criminal courts, juvenile offenders, rehabilitation
        programs, and other subjects in which the Correctional Association was interested. Documents
        include published reports, news clippings and newsletters of other organizations,
        affidavits, and brochures. Correspondence from various Correctional Association personnel is
        scattered throughout this series. Most of it is routine (e.g., requests for copies of
        reports), but some of the files dating from the 1960s contain copies of letters detailing
        specific aspects of New York State criminal law and correctional facility policies.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous Publication Files can be found in Series 8 and are rather sporadic (1944,
        1976-79, 1982-86). This series consists of material produced or collected by the
        Correctional Association. It contains a handbook, manual, brochure, book, pamphlet,
        bulletins, and annual reports published by the Correctional Association. There is also
        published and unpublished material that the Association gathered and reproduced upon
        request. Topics covered include alcoholism, the prison population explosion, correctional
        costs, and annual reports of the Association to the New York State Legislature. Only one
        publication dates from 1944.</p>
      <p>Series 9 is the Publication by Others Series, 1961-75 and contains articles, papers and
        reports created or received by the Association and reprinted for distribution on request.
        Topics included are alcoholism, narcotics addiction, problems of the criminal justice
        system, recidivism, mental health, juveniles and crime, pornography, victimless crimes, and
        General Secretary reports of the Association.</p>
      <p>Series 10 contains foundations and fundraising files from 1962-88. This series contains
        information about numerous philanthropic foundations from which the Association sought
        funding. These files were kept separate from other records created or gathered by
        Association staff and contain annual reports and other items published by numerous
        foundations, applications for funding, and correspondence. Also included is Association
        staffers' and board members' manuscript lists of contacts, fundraising ideas, and internal
        memoranda.</p>
      <p>Additional records were received from the Correctional Association of New York in August
        2006. These records have not yet been intellectually or physically integrated into the
        collection. An inventory of the records created by the staff of the Correctional Association
        is available in the Records received in August 2006 section of the finding aid.</p>

          <p>This series consists of correspondence, meeting minutes of the Board of Directors
            (1977-1985) and the Executive Committee (1971-1973, 1984), and committee files created
            or gathered by the executive director, chairman, president, general secretary, and
            committee chairs of the Association. It also contains biographical information about
            prospective board members gathered by the Nominating Committee (1963-1967, 1969,
            1971-1972, 1974-1982, 1984). Other documents in the series include meeting agendas,
            memoranda, grant proposals, reports, membership statistics, and records concerning
            bequests and endowments made to the Association. This material concerns prison
            conditions, children of offenders, sentencing policies, court rulings concerning
            prisoners' efforts to form labor unions, construction of new correctional facilities,
            and the operations of the Association itself. Letters from inmates concerning living
            conditions in various correctional facilities, transfers from one facility to another,
            health issues, allegations of abuse by corrections officers, and post-release work
            arrangements and drug-rehabilitation programs are scattered throughout the series. One
            of the letters (1985) directed to Correctional Association President Robert Gangi was
            written by Jean Harris, who became interested in the special problems of female inmates
            and their children during her imprisonment for murder. Note that the files created by
            the Institution's Visiting Committee are housed in Series 3, Prison Visits Files, circa
            1915-1985, and files created by the Narcotics Committee are housed in Series 4,
            Narcotics Committee Files, 1949-1975.</p>

          <p>This series consists exclusively of the annual reports on prison and jail conditions
            that the Prison Association/Correctional Association submitted to the New York State
            Assembly. The reports contain minutes of meetings, presidential addresses, committee
            reports, reports on individual prisons and prison conditions, prison reform campaigns in
            New York State, transcripts of testimony before the NYS legislature on pending policy
            measures, and lists of members and corresponding members of the Association. Reports
            published during the latter half of the nineteenth century chronicle the Association's
            role in establishing national and international prison reform organizations and
            conferences and furnish information about prison policies elsewhere in the United States
            and the world.</p>

          <p>This series consists of material generated in connection with the Correctional
            Association's statutory responsibility for inspecting jails, prisons, and adolescent
            detention facilities in New York State. Documents in this series were created by the
            Association's General Secretary, Institutions Visiting Committee, and other personnel
            and include correspondence, prison visit reports, prison tour requests, memoranda,
            affidavits, and other court records. Also included are records concerning Correctional
            Association President Adam McQuillan's 1977 visit to the Southern Ohio Correctional
            Facility. The only document from circa 1915 is a pamphlet describing a traveling
            exhibition concerning the New York State prison system.</p>

          <p>This series was created by the Association's Narcotics Committee, which apparently kept
            its records separate from other material generated by members of the Board of Directors.
            It contains reports, pamphlets, articles, brochures, memoranda, news clippings, and some
            correspondence. Among the subjects covered are: the New York State [?] Narcotics
            Addiction Control Commission, drug rehabilitation programs, the Federal Bureau of
            Narcotics, and methadone maintenance programs.</p>

          <p>This series contains material created or collected by Correctional Association staffers
            responsible for operating programs that furnished direct services to inmates and their
            families. The Association's Family Services Bureau, Legal Services Bureau, and Social
            Services Bureau were long-term programs that were phased out during the late 1970s and
            early 1980s. Programs established during the 1980s were grant-funded demonstration
            projects designed to encourage emulation; the Association did not have the financial
            resources needed to sustain long-term social service programs. Of interest particular
            interest is the Association's short-term program to furnish counseling services to young
            offenders sent to the Adolescent Reception and Detention Center on Rikers Island
            (1981-1982). Also of interest are the documents generated in connection with the
            Association's efforts to establish an Ombudsman Program (1972-1973) and the ensuing
            resistance of Governor Nelson Rockefeller and state corrections officials.</p>

          <p>This series consists of material created or collected by Correctional Association
            staffers and board members engaged in short-term projects designed to produce written
            reports about various aspects of the correctional system; copies of many of these
            reports are included. Of particular interest are the Case Histories Project (1983-1985),
            Idle Time Project (1981-1985), and the Prison and Jail Conditions Project (1982-1986),
            which entailed extensive surveys of conditions and inmate programs available in New York
            State correctional facilities and generated correspondence and other material from
            inmates. Also of note is the Prison Mental Hygiene Project (1985-1988) that documents
            the programs and resources then available to prisoners with mental illness and
            developmental disabilities. Two of the projects, the State Planning Project (1981-1982)
            and the Prison Overcrowding Project (1982-1984), concern crowding in prisons and
            alternatives to new prison construction. This series also contains material generated in
            connection with the AIDS in Prison Project (1985-1988), the Budget Education Project
            (1983-1985), the Latino Project (1985-1988), and proposals for several other projects
            that the Association did not complete.</p>

          <p>This series consists of a wide array of material concerning correctional facility
            operations, criminal law and the criminal courts, juvenile offenders, rehabilitation
            programs, and other subjects in which the Correctional Association was interested.
            Documents include published reports, news clippings, newsletters of other organizations,
            affidavits, and brochures. Correspondence from various Correctional Association
            personnel is scattered throughout this series. Most of it is routine (e.g., requests for
            copies of reports), but some of the files dating from the 1960s contain copies of
            letters detailing specific aspects of New York State criminal law and correctional
            facility policies.</p>
