      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The Capital Area Council of Churches (CACC) was founded in 1941 as the Federation of Churches of 
Christ in Albany, N.Y. and Vicinity. The name was changed to the CACC as part of the adoption of a 
new organizational constitution submitted for approval to the Annual Meeting in June 1958. The 
preliminary considerations for forming this organization had been discussed among four Albany area 
clergymen: the Rev. William H. McConaghy of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Erville 
Maynard of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, the Rev. Arthur Adams of the First Presbyterian Church and Dr.
 Kenneth B. Wells of the Westminster Presbyterian Church. These discussions culminated in a meeting of 
 area congregation representatives on April 4, 1941 when a "meeting of Clergy and Laity" was held "to 
 consider a proposal for the establishment of a City Federation of Churches in Albany, N.Y." (Minutes, April 4, 1941.) The 
 first meeting was chaired by the Rev. M. Stephen James who summarized earlier, efforts to organize and 
 credited Mr. Benton S. Hoit with the exploratory work of a draft constitution. Three of these 
 organizational meetings were held in 1941 resulting in the official incorporation of the Federation
 of Churches of Christ in Albany, New York, and Vicinity on January 12, 1942.</p>
      <p>The Federation was intended to encompass, absorb, coordinate and extend the community service and 
ministry functions of several existing organizations including the Albany Protestant Welfare Society 
(House of Friendship), the Albany City Council of Religious Education, the State College Christian
 Association, the Federation of Youth, and the Ministerial Association. These organizations continued 
 to operate under their own names, but were brought to varying degrees under the organizational and 
 financial umbrella of the Federation. Later additional affiliations included: the Council of Church
 Women of Albany in January 1944; Chapel House (Albany Collegiate Interfaith Center) on December 16, 
 1966, and the Seaman's Agency of Albany (the Port Ministry) in 1978.</p>
      <p>As stated in its Constitution of 1948, "The particular objects for which this organization is formed
 are to develop the spirit of Christian fellowship and to promote through cooperative effort the 
 spiritual, moral, social and civic welfare of the community." Rewording in later revisions elaborates 
 and specifies. The CACC administration currently consists of four officers: President, Vice-President,
 Recording Secretary and Treasurer and a Council Assembly consisting of the clergy and two lay persons
 from each member congregation (previously there were additional representatives for those congregations 
 larger than a certain size), and the director and two members of other member organizations. They are
 governed by a Board of Directors consisting of the four officers, committee chairs and a maximum of
 twelve members-at-large chosen from local laity and clergy of member congregations. Earlier constitutions
 included one member of each communion in place of the members-at-large. Operational responsibilities are
 handled by an Executive Committee consisting of the four officers (previously including division chairs
 and department chairs) with daily administrative responsibilities residing with an Executive Director
 hired by the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>As of the date of transition from the Federation to the Council in 1958, during the presidency
 of Dr. Carlyle Adams, the organization consisted of divisions based on geographic proximity; 
 and departments which acted as administrative units or as liaisons to the semi-autonomous organizations
 which provide services to the community under joint auspices. These were separated into: Program 
 Departments of Community Ministry, Hospital Ministry, Student Work, Christian Education, Social 
 Education and Action, and Evangelism; General Departments of United Church Women, United Church 
 Men, and Ministers' Association; and Central Departments such as Business and Finance and Public
 Relations. Current structure provides for standing committees which include the Executive Committee,
 Nominating Committee, Finance Committee and the Personnel Committee. Previously existing geographic 
 divisions are not specified as of the 1980 Revised Constitution.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The majority of records in this collection are board minutes (with organizational constitutions, Director's Reports, and some committee minutes) reports, newsletters, administrative files, subject files, and some correspondence. There is also a collection of clippings from local newspapers.</p>
      <p>Well structured documentation, in the form of meeting minutes, of the formative period of the organization allow for a determination of the principle factors, both human and situational, for the genesis of the CACC. There are numerous sources (minutes, newsletters, annual reports) of the names of individuals and the roles they played in the organization; names, locations, size, relative prosperity and denomination of member congregations; and information pertaining to the other groups, individuals, and organizations which provided services in the Capital District.</p>
      <p>Many of the records show the degree to which the organization was concerned and involved with issues and events of local, national and international concern including World War II, the anti-Communist fervor, the Civil Rights Movement, the Abortion debate, the evolution of the State University of New York system, urban blight, and fair housing.</p>
      <p>Early correspondence was not usually kept or was only occasionally filed with the meeting minutes at which the subject matter was discussed. Several references are made to a city-wide survey conducted in the summer of 1946 to determine area residents' religious denomination and to which congregation (if any) they belonged. However, no results of these efforts has been located beyond a January 1947 mention that the report of the findings is not yet ready. </p>
      <p>A mention in correspondence is made of a visit to the area of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on June 14, 1961. Regrettably, there is no further mention of the planned speaking engagement, nor a report of it in meeting minutes or subject files. There are numerous gaps in the coverage of newsletters, annual reports and meeting minutes. These sometimes occur at times when social issues (such as civil rights) were most likely occupying the efforts and energies of Council personnel. Unfortunately, it is these times when records of events and issues, as they affected this organization, would be most valuable.

          <p>The Administrative Files follow standard practice using the name of report type, originating committee, special event or external entity as the subject heading. The deepest historical contents are found in folders for Annual Reports (beginning 1944), Black Book (1945-56), Budgets (1954-56), Federation Membership (1947-51), Membership Committee (1942-47), and Organization of the Federation (1941-48). It should be noted that much financial, membership and special events information not included in these Administrative Files can be found filed with the Meeting Minutes at which the topic or report was discussed or in the Annual Reports.</p>
          <p>Of notable length are the holdings of Annual Reports, which cover the years from 1944 - 2002 (missing are 45-46, 48-52, 53-54 and 1980). These consist of the year-end reports from the President and Executive Director; summary reports of the major standing and special events committees; and Treasurer's report and budget as presented to the Annual Assemblies. The financial reports contained therein include the past year's income and expenses including support received from each member congregation (grouped by denomination). A calendar of upcoming events for the year is also presented, as are award and scholarship recipient's names. The Annual Reports also include a full listing of nominated officers and board members for the forthcoming year containing full name and church community to which they belong. Anniversary year's reports from 1981, 1990, and 2000 include reflections, summaries and histories.</p>

          <p>Most of the correspondence in this series (with a few exceptions) is from the 1980s during the directorships of Joyce Steinkraus Giles and James H. Snedeker, Jr.. Most earlier materials were filed with the meeting minutes or with the subject files to which they pertain. Much of the included materials consist of letters sent by individual contributors (usually along with a donation) and letters and faxes between CACC and other local service organizations, clergy members and political leaders.</p>
          <p>Topics center around thank you letters; invitations to special events; requests for support of new or ongoing Council initiatives and programs; activities related to the protests against Apartheid in South Africa; family planning issues; and building / facility usage.</p>
          <p>Folder 19 (Outgoing, 1986-1987) includes a "Policy Option Ballot" for then-current topics on U.S. Central American policy from the Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, Washington, D.C.; and a letter from the National Council of Churches concerning guidelines for new Social Security Administration policies pertaining to ordained ministers (May 2, 1956) as well as official brochures from the Social Security administration regarding the changes. </p>
          <p>Featured among correspondents are The Hon. Erastus Corning II (1909 - 1983), Mayor of Albany from 1942 - 1983; The Most Rev. Howard Hubbard, Roman Catholic Bishop of Albany from 1977 to the present; and Dr. Henry Pitney Van Dusen (1897 - 1975), President of New York's Union Theological Seminary from 1945 - 1963 (correspondence includes Van Dusen's resume as of 1947 - Folder 16). Others include clergy of member churches, health care facility directors, and state and national affiliated organizations</p>

          <p>Early examples of the monthly newsletters are sparse with some years being represented by a single month's edition. Evidence that a letter was definitely produced every month without fail is not forthcoming, and thus the included examples could be exhaustive. Contents typically include sections on seasonal celebrations; announcements from various committees and sub-groups; upcoming special events information (or reports on those past); and in early examples, listings of recommended radio programs and new books on matters of faith.</p>
          <p>Relevant topics from the news began to be included in the mid-1950s editions, and radio program and book promotions ended. Announcements of Welcome to clergy joining member congregations are included periodically. Occasionally included are newsletters of other affiliated organizations of those covering topics of interest, such as the NYS Commission Against Discrimination (Fall 1961).</p>
          <p>At some point between April 1978 and February 1982 (series holdings do not include this date range), the newsletter came to be called Connection. Examples from 1982 onward are more numerous and have fewer gaps in coverage than is true of earlier years.</p>

          <p>Series 5 includes minutes of the three formative meetings held in 1941 as well as the official documentation of incorporation and topical correspondence. Included in the minutes, or as supplements filed with them, are lists of member churches, size of congregations, financial contributions and indications of existing organizations particular to a single denomination. The names of member congregation's representatives and Council officers are also included with consistency.</p>
          <p>Included is one folder of older meeting minutes (Box 1, Folder 1: 1940, 1942-45) from the Albany City Council of Religious Education, which later came under the auspices of the CACC and Hospital Ministry minutes (Box 2, Folder 18: 1954-61). The remainder of the series are minutes from the monthly meetings of the executive committee and/or board of directors of the Federation/Council. Correspondence is often filed along with the minutes of the meeting at which the letter was discussed. Typically the minutes include a list of attendees; the leader of the opening prayer; the approval of the minutes of the previous meting; report from the president, executive director, treasurer and committee chairs; record of any resolutions or topics of discussion; announcements and a statement of adjournment.</p>
