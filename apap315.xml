      <abstract label="Abstract:">The records of the New York State Conference of Local Mental
        Hygiene Directors trace the development of mental healthcare throughout the state from the
        early 1950s through the beginning of the twenty-first century. Established in the mid-1970s,
        the Conference's records include correspondence, memos, meeting minutes, reports, and
        manuals that chronicle the efforts of mental health professionals as they encourage local,
        county, and state agencies to provide quality, affordable services for persons living with
        mental illness, chemical dependency, and/or developmental disability.</abstract>

      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The New York State Conference of Local Mental Hygiene Directors (NYSCLMHD) specializes in
        advocacy for the mentally ill, the developmentally disabled, and/or people with chemical
        dependencies. The Conference also extends outreach efforts to the families of those they
        serve. Its efforts focus on ensuring that people with various mental health needs have
        quality, affordable care, guiding formation of local and state policies to make sure that
        they are as current and relevant as possible. [1]</p>
      <p>The NYSCLMHD was formed in 1976 under Article 41 of the state Mental Hygiene Law, which
        covers local and unified services. Article 41 was “designed to enable and encourage local
        governments to develop in the community preventive, rehabilitative, and treatment services
        offering continuity of care” and stresses the need for cooperation among local, county, and
        state governments in order to provide the best level of mental healthcare. [2] As such, the
        Conference— operating at the county level—serves as a link between statewide and local
        services, confirming that policies are carried out efficiently in the realms of clinical and
        rehabilitative work. The Conference opened its Albany, New York headquarters in 1978, and as an
        affiliate of the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC), it was originally located
        in the NYSAC building on State Street. [3] The Conference continues to be affiliated with
        NYSAC but has since moved to a different building in downtown Albany. </p>
      <p>The NYSCLMHD, which is a not-for-profit organization, oversees a complex and extensive
        network of professionals, requiring participation by mental health directors and
        commissioners from New York State’s 57 counties and New York City*. [4] These are the people
        who are already coordinating mental health care services in their own counties and therefore
        have the knowledge and background to correlate services between local, county, and state
        agencies. Over the years they have worked closely with the New York State Office of Mental
        Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, Office of Mental Health, Division of Alcoholism
        and Alcohol Abuse, and Division of Substance Abuse as they analyze the state’s mental
        healthcare system and make recommendations for improvement. Daily operations are overseen by
        the Conference’s executive director, who in turn reports to the executive committee and
        chairperson. The executive committee, which meets monthly, is made up of past and present
        committee chairpersons, current officers, and regional representatives. All members meet
        twice a year at conferences, and officers are elected for two-year terms, as per the
        Conference’s bylaws. [5] </p>
      <p>The Conference has devoted itself to a vast number of projects since its inception in the
        mid-1970s. A sample of its work includes children’s mental welfare, adult housing needs,
        affordable services, and care of the mentally ill during and after prison sentences. Over
        the years, members have both sponsored and attended many workshops and conferences designed
        to enhance the skills of those working on behalf of the mentally ill, chemically dependent,
        and developmentally disabled. It also continues to focus effort on bringing greater
        understanding of mental health issues to the general public as well as to key professions,
        such as law enforcement and education, so that people with special needs can be more
        efficiently integrated into everyday life.</p>

        considered to be a separate county. (See www.nysegov.com)</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of the New York State Conference of Local Mental Hygiene Directors (NYSCLMHD)
        contain meeting minutes, correspondence, reports, and newsletters documenting the founding
        and day-to-day activities of the group, including original by-laws and articles of
        incorporation. There are also records of many of the NYSCLMHD’s specific projects from the
        late 1970s through the early 2000s, such as managed care/Medicaid/special needs plans, grant
        applications, juvenile care issues, housing concerns, partnerships with other organizations,
        disaster preparedness, and care of mental needs patients in prison. </p>
      <p>Researchers will also find some materials on the history of mental health care in the state
        of New York. In addition, there are documents pertaining to mental health professionals’
        increased efforts to partner with law enforcement to achieve better understanding of those
        living with mental illness, developmental disabilities, or the effects of substance abuse. </p>
      <p>In most instances, folder titles have been retained according to the record-keeping habits
        of the NYSCLMHD.</p>

          <p>The administrative files contain executive meeting minutes from the Conference’s
            earliest days through the late 1980s. During those years, members kept the minutes in
            large, hardcover binders; the archivist removed the papers from those binders for
            preservation purposes and placed them in acid-free folders in the order in which they
            appeared in the original binders. In the 1990s, Conference members began filing their
            meeting minutes under the heading of “chronological files” along with meeting
            announcements and correspondence. The chronological files became series two of this
            collection and researchers will find more meeting minutes there. However, there is a gap
            in the Conference's meeting minutes from 1989-1994.</p>
          <p>This series also contains founding documents such as original charters and by-laws as
            well as files pertaining to activities of the executive director. Please note that there
            are several executive committee meeting files in Series #5: Projects and Committees.</p>

          <p>The name of this series comes right from the Conference’s own record-keeping system. In
            the 1990s it stopped storing meeting minutes separately in oversized binders and began
            interfiling them with correspondence, meeting announcements, memorandums, and
            treasurer’s reports in folders labeled with the current month and year. Minutes include
            regularly scheduled events, such as executive committee meetings, as well as ad hoc
            meetings. Memos include those sent by the NYSCLMHD as well as those received by the
            Conference from outside sources such the New York State Office of Mental Health and the
            Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse.</p>

          <p>This series contains information related to state reinvestment plans, Medicaid
            concerns, managed care, and housing. While materials on all of these topics also can be
            found in Series 5, 6, and 7, the documents in this series were all kept specifically by
            the director of legislative and government affairs and therefore remain together in

          <p>These records are specific to the counties of New York as they participated in
            coordinated care efforts for people with mental health needs. There are documents
            regarding activities unique to certain counties, such as closures of facilities and
            resignations of Conference members. There are also letters, memos, and reports covering
            topics like mandate relief recommendations, comprehensive outpatient programs, health
            needs surveys, and funding issues.</p>

          <p>This series focuses on some of the Conference’s more specific endeavors, including (but
            not limited to) those with definitive start and end dates as opposed to ongoing tasks.
            Examples include the Kids Oneida project, the Commission on the 21st Century, various
            grant applications, and the committees for developmental disabilities and chemical
            dependency.</p>

          <p>Managed care, in its most general form, refers to coordination of health services in
            such a way that quality care is provided, but costs are kept low. Many of the records in
            this series deal with Medicare issues, of which special needs plans (SNPs) are an
            important part since they focus effort on particular groups of people with very specific
            needs. Researchers will find a variety of records such as memos, letters, information
            packets, and meeting notes covering areas like Medicare financing, managed care in rural
            areas, strategic planning, technical assistance, and committee work.</p>

          <p>The subject files house documents of long-term value that do not belong to the
            Conference’s other record series. There are correspondence and memo files of specific
            members of the group, such as Peter Freed (counsel) and Gerry Landsberg (New York
            University), background on shared staff issues, and information on partnerships with the
            New York State divisions of alcohol abuse and chemical dependency as well as state
            housing committees. Researchers will also find documents pertaining to consolidation of
            services and positions over the years, particularly in the 1990s. Additionally, there
            are manuals, booklets, and conference materials about disaster preparedness in the
            mental health profession. Most of the collection’s photographs are also located in this
            series, with the exception of the Commission on the 21st Century images which are in
            Series #5.</p>

          <p>The Conference began publishing its own newsletter in the early days of its existence,
            but most of the issues from the 1980s and 1990s are not included in this collection. Researchers will
            find a consistent run from 1979 through 1981, a few issues from 1993, 1994, and the late
            1990s, then another consistent run from 2000 through 2008. There are also several issues
            of a newsletter published specially by the Conference chair.</p>

          <p>This series consists of various reports and booklets that were used by the NYSCLMHD in
            the course of business, but were not always produced by the Conference. They are from
            organizations such as the New York State legislature, the Office of Mental Health, the
            Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, the state prison system, and the Conference of
            Local Mental Hygiene Directors themselves. Topics range from mental healthcare in the
            twenty-first century, to juvenile mental health, to criminal offenders with mental
            illness.</p>
