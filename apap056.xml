      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Albert Jack Abrams was born in Stamford, Connecticut, on May 29, 1915. 
  Abrams began his university studies at the University of Michigan in 1932, and 
  he attended the National Institute for Public Affairs in Washington, D.C., in 
  1935. He received an A.B. from New York University in 1936, and he continued 
  his studies at Columbia University (1940) and the Cornell School of Labor and 
  Industrial Relations (1946).[1]</p>
      <p>He married Ruth Elsie Weinert on March 7, 1943, and they had three children: 
  David, Eugenie, and Valerie.His first wife died in 1959.On December 
  16, 1967, Abrams married Lorena Friedman Kessler, a widow who had one adult son, Marc.[2]</p>
      <p>Albert J. Abrams was a lecturer at the Vassar Summer Institute and other universities, 
  and he taught a seminar on legislative administration at the Graduate School 
  of Public Affairs, at SUNY, Albany, in 1975.In 1936, while still attending 
  New York University, Abrams worked in the New York State Senate as a research 
  assistant to Senator Thomas circa Desmond of Newburgh.[3] 
  He was the director of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on Problems 
  of Aging (1947-58), city manager of Newburgh, NY (1958-60), and director of 
  social and economic planning for the New York State Senate (1960-62).[4] 
  Abrams served in the Senate as a special assistant (1960-61) and then executive 
  assistant (1961-62) to Senate Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney. Abrams 
  was elected Secretary of the Senate on January 6, 1963, and was re-elected to 
  the post in January 1966.[5] He continued as Secretary 
  until 1976. </p>
      <p>The American Society for Public Administration awarded Abrams the Governor 
  Alfred E. Smith award for "outstanding administrative achievement in a staff 
  position" in 1964.[6] A member of the American Society 
  for Public Administration, Abrams served as the president of the Capital District 
  Chapter in 1968.[7]</p>
      <p>Abrams wrote articles on public administration for technical journals and also 
explained the workings of the legislative process to the general
public through articles in popular magazines.[8] Abrams also wrote
articles for the Delmar Spotlight of humorous anecdotes and his take on the century.</p>
      <p>Albert J. Abrams died in 1993.</p>

      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
      <p>The collection is organized alphabetically. There are no series.</p>
    </arrangement>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records in this manuscript collection were originally arranged in a numerically 
  classified subject file under the general subject of legislative administration. 
  This filing system was never completely utilized (most of the folders were empty 
  because no documents fitting the descriptions for those folders were ever created) 
  and there was no key that explained the numbers, so there has been no attempt 
  to maintain that filing system. However, most folders retain the originally 
  assigned titles. The folders have been rearranged in alphabetical order 
  to simplify searching. </p>
      <p>Since Abrams worked in legislative administration and also taught about it 
  (through articles and through classes he taught), his ideas about the subject 
  are well considered and of interest to someone researching the subject. 
  Beyond this, the papers offer a glimpse into the day-to-day running of the New 
  York State Senate, such as handling the Senate's internal budget, space allocation, 
  maintenance, security and personnel. Abrams looked at legislative bills 
  from the standpoint of what these cost to print and how to handle the physical 
  volume of these bills, rather than that of the intended legislative effect. 
  These papers also contain some files on personal interrelations among legislators, 
  which are interesting given the effect that such matters can have on the passage 
  of bills.The most interesting of these is "Socialization of Senators 
  Within the Senate Chamber" (1975), which tallies up conversations between senators 
  and names those initiating and receiving conversations. </p>
      <p>This series contains copies of essays, staff reports, newspaper clippings, 
  notes, memoranda, photographs and correspondence pertaining to Abrams' work 
  as secretary of the New York State Senate. This series includes files 
  on aspects of administrating the functions of the senate, essays he wrote on 
  legislative administration, and teaching material from a course he taught on 
  legislative administration in 1975. The papers also contain some published 
  material, such as senate handbooks. </p>
      <p>For further information on Abrams, a researcher should refer to the records 
  of American Society for Public Administration--Capital District Chapter. 
  These records do not contain his president's records, but there is at least 
  one printed message from him found in the chapter's 1968 annual report. </p>
