      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Organizational charts in this collection span a wide range of the University's history, from the era of the State College for Teachers (1914-1959) through the various iterations of the State University, culminating in the present day University at Albany.  The organization of the University changes frequently.  Sometimes these changes have been minor: for example, slight changes in department names.  Some of the changes have been more significant: the University has undergone major restructuring at various points in its history.</p>
