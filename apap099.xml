      <p>Access to this record group is unrestricted with the exception of several folders marked
        below. While Dr. Ivan Steen, the Project's Director, subsequently asked individuals
        interviewed for the oral history projects he conducted to sign a clearance form or an
        agreement, not all interview files donated to the archive contain forms. In addition, some
        individuals asked for their interviews to be permanently sealed or sealed until a later
        date. Therefore notes, transcripts and audio of a select number of interviews are restricted
        until clearance may be obtained from the interviewees or their heirs.</p>

      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>United University Professions (UUP), established in 1973, is the collective bargaining
        agent representing the faculty and non-teaching professional staff of the State University
        of New York (SUNY). The United University Professions Oral History Project was funded by UUP
        and conducted by the Oral History Program of the Department of History, University at
        Albany, SUNY, under the supervision of Professor Ivan D. Steen. The primary intent of the
        UUP Oral History Project was to document the early history of UUP and its predecessor
        organizations. Angelica Lewis, a University at Albany graduate student in Public History,
        was hired to conduct the interviews. After researching UUP's history and conducting
        preliminary interviews with numerous people formerly and currently active in UUP, Lewis
        formally interviewed forty-two individuals. Those interviews were conducted between February
        and October 1990.</p>
      <p>Topics of discussion include UUP's early history and its predecessor (the Senate
        Professional Association [SPA]) and other organizations that attempted to become the
        bargaining agent of the faculty and professional staff at SUNY, including the State
        University Federation of Teachers (SUFT, which would later merge with SPA to form UUP) and
        the American Association of University Professors (AAUP); the interviewees' reasons for
        becoming active in UUP; events and activities at various SUNY campuses regarding collective
        bargaining, UUP's predecessors, and UUP; negotiations and other dealings with the State of
        New York, and the individuals from the Governor's Office of Employee Relations who were
        involved in the negotiating process; the individual personalities that made up the early UUP
        leadership; internal political activities at UUP, particularly its Reform Caucus and United
        Caucus; the creation and impact of the agency fee law on UUP and its members; the challenge
        to UUP's position as collective bargaining agent in 1978 by the National Education
        Association and its affiliate, the New York Educators Association (NEA/NYEA); and the
        different objectives/interests of academic and professional members in the bargaining unit
        represented by UUP. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The United University Professions (UUP) Oral History Project Collection consists of four
        series: the recorded audio tapes of the formal oral history interviews, transcripts of those
        interviews, the interviewer's research files including her interview notes and materials she
        collected on UUP, and the project's administrative files.</p>
      <p>The interviews primarily focus on the early history of UUP from the activities in the early
        1970s of the Senate Professional Association (SPA) and the State University Federation of
        Teachers (SUFT) which merged to form UUP in 1973 through the administrations of UUP's first
        three presidents (Lawrence DeLucia, Samuel Wakshull, and Nuala McGann Drescher, who served
        between May 1973 to May 1987), and part of the administration of UUP's fourth president,
        John M. Reilly, who was president at the time the interviews were conducted in 1990.</p>
      <p>Records regarding the activities of UUP during this time period, and relating to the many
        of the events, individuals, and organizations to which interviewees refer, can be found in
        the records of United University Professions (APAP-039). The records of the United
        University Professions (UUP) Albany Chapter (APAP-054) document some of the activities of
        this UUP chapter. Interested researchers also should condult the papers of Eugene Link
        (APAP-025), a professor of history at SUNY Plattsburgh who was active in the early years of
        UUP and in UUP's establishment of membership for retired members. Link's papers focus on his
        career as a teacher, author, social historian, labor activist, and Christian minister. The
        records of WAMC/Northeast Public Radio (APAP-138) include episodes of programs on which UUP
        leaders appeared.</p>
      <p>For a detailed history of UUP itself, see the Administrative History for the records of
        United University Professions (APAP-039).</p>
      <p>For more oral histories conducted by Dr. Ivan Steen, researchers should refer to the Ivan
        Steen Papers (APAP-219).</p>

          <p>Transcriptions of recorded interviews in Series 1. The interviews cover events and
            personalities from the years prior to UUP's creation in 1973 through the first years of
            the administration of its fourth president, John M. Reilly, who was president when the
            interviews were conducted in 1990. Interviewees include individuals who served as
            president of UUP, as members of UUP's Executive Board, as officers of UUP, or who were
            otherwise active in UUP's creation and early history. Some individual names are spelled
            irregularly from transcript to transcript. Consult the records of United University
            Professions, particularly publications such as <emph render="italic">The Voice</emph>
            for the correct spelling of individual names. The researcher should note that not all
            individuals in this series participated in a formal interview.</p>

          <p>The bulk of this series is made up of the interviewer's notes regarding each individual
            formally interviewed and potential interviewees. In addition to including the
            interviewer's handwritten notes taken during the formal taped interviews and during
            preliminary interviews with subjects, most interviewee files include a "UUP Potential
            Interview Candidate Fact Sheet", listing each individual's involvement in UUP at the
            statewide and chapter level (and in UUP's predecessors if applicable), including offices
            held and committees assigned to. Files for individuals formally interviewed often
            include an outline of issues to be covered during the interview and additional summaries
            of the individual's UUP activities. </p>

          <p>This series contains correspondence to interviewees to provide them with instructions
            on reviewing the transcript of their interview and the types of materials to correct, as
            well as release forms from the interviewees. Also included are the transcripts that were
            marked by the interviewees with their corrections. The correspondence is predominantly
            form letters. However, there is occasional correspondence specifically directed to an
            individual either to address concerns he or she raised about the transcript or to follow
            up regarding the status of the respective transcript and release. (Some additional
            correspondence with interviewees can be found in the Interview Notes and Background
            Materials in Series 3). Release forms and transcripts have been marked by the
            interviewees regarding any seals that they wished to place on their interview as well as
            information they wished to have deleted from the transcript, making the transcripts
            unavailable to researchers until the seals expires, or not at all in cases were text was
            deleted. Some interviewees did not return corrected copies of their transcripts. If
            correspondence in this series reflected the narrator's opinion and/or reservations
            regarding the transcript and interview, the original was placed with the interview
            transcript for that individual and a copy retained in this series. As noted above,
            access to some of the corrected narrator transcripts in this series is either
            permanently or temporarily restricted. All such restrictions are noted in the box and
            folder list. </p>
