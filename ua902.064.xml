      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Louis Fletcher Ismay (commonly known as Lou Ismay) was born in Bronxville, New York on February 25, 1925. Ismay received a Bachelor of Education from the University of the State of New York at New Paltz in 1949, and a Master of Arts in education administration from Columbia University in 1958. Prior to finishing his education Ismay served in the military from September 1943 through June 1946. Ismay was selected to be the coordinator of the Environmental Forum course at the State University of New York at Albany (as the University at Albany, SUNY was then known) in 1970 because of his extensive history and experience in administrative, educational, as well as executive positions that required creative and visionary approaches to maximize resources. [Resume of Louis Ismay, undated. Series 1: Environmental Forum, Box 2, Folder 40].</p>
      <p>The Environmental Forum course taught by Ismay was a part of the Environmental Studies Program at the University. Additional information about the Environmental Studies Program is available in the finding aid for the collection. Ismay taught the course from its inception in the spring of 1970, when the environmental ideals that this course was based on were spreading to campuses nationwide, until its demise in 1977 because of budget cuts. The themes of the course included new measures for waste management through recycling, strengthening pollution regulations, and reducing unnecessary consumption by individuals. Ismay taught students to take a proactive stance to their surroundings, both environmental and societal, which is reflected in the student projects in this collection. Ismay's students did not passively observe their surroundings, but went out armed with ideas and came back with environmental awareness that they then tried to share with others. Ismay currently lives in Altamont, New York.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Louis Ismay Papers document the history of the Environmental Forum at the State University of New York at Albany (as the University at Albany, SUNY was then known) from 1970-1977, as well as the Environmental Studies Program. The collection contains information on the Environmental Forum, the Protect Your Environment Club (PYE), administrative files, student writings, subject files, correspondence, and publications. The student writings are from Ismay's Environmental Forum classes from 1970-1977. This series, along with parts of the Environmental Forum and correspondence series, is restricted from use. This course was held under different numbers during its existence, including A&amp;S 201 and Env.250a and b.</p>
      <p>Many environmental issues facing the Capital Region, as well as the nation between 1968 and 1977, are documented in the Ismay Papers. Recycling, pollution control, consumption reduction, and environmental awareness are all topics that can be found not only in the subject files of the papers, but also in each series. The Environmental Forum was created as a result of the environmental concern that swept through universities on a national level during this time. The purpose of the Forum was active involvement of environmentally concerned individuals with their community in an attempt to better the environment that they lived in. Some papers appear to be from environmental law classes and other related classes. This makes it seem that this collection includes papers from other professors in the Environmental Studies Program, including Rosemary Nichols, an instructor of the law classes.</p>
      <p>The collection lacks biographical information of significance about Lou Ismay. Other than learning about a few of his interests, little personal information can be found in his papers. Many of the documents in the collection are damaged as a result of poor storage prior to arriving at the University at Albany. The strength of the collection lies not in the educational departments that are represented in the collection, but in the overall impression of the rise of environmental awareness among students at the University at Albany, which is one small link to understanding the rise in environmental concern on campuses throughout the United States during this period. This can be seen through national events such as Earth Day and Earth Week that were begun in this era (see Governor Malcolm Wilson executive order creating Earth Week in 1974 in series 2).</p>

          <p>This series documents the entire history of the Environmental Forum at the University at Albany, SUNY from 1969-1977. The Environmental Forum was a course in the Environmental Studies Program at the University at Albany. The purpose of the course was for students to examine the problems created by an overcrowded society in relation to the environment and man. The inter-disciplinary approach the Forum took allowed anyone to take the class, no matter their academic background. The design of the course sent students out into the community to do hands-on projects. Course handouts, in-class assignments, evaluations, and other material comprise the bulk of this series.</p>
          <p>Some of the information in this series is restricted. The restricted folders are labeled "personal student information" and contain confidential information, such as social security numbers.</p>

          <p>Protect Your Environment (PYE) was a club at the University at Albany, SUNY, that was an off-shoot of the Environmental Forum. The club was formed in 1969 based on an example from the Thomas School in Connecticut. The club promoted environmental awareness through activities such as teach-ins and Earth Day. In 1974, the club helped to convince Governor Malcolm Wilson to declare a week in April as Earth Week. A framed certificate of the declaration is in the series. This declaration, along with other material too large for standard archival boxes are in a separate flat box. A glass, pink pig head mounted to a wooden board is also part of the series, along with PYE handouts and flyers, the club's constitution, receipts, bills, and other material.</p>

          <p>The projects of students in the Environmental Forum that were kept by Lou Ismay can be found in this series. The projects are filed in alphabetical order by name of student. Journals, student papers, student project reports, and student autobiographies are part of this series. The papers are on a range of environmental issues with many relating to recycling and other relevant projects done around campus and the Capital Region. Photographs and slides that accompany student papers were kept together with the papers. Oversized material is filed separately and includes 4 posters and other oversized projects. Audiovisuals for student projects are also in the series, including 11 audiocassette tapes and 1 reel-to-reel audiotape.</p>

          <p>The files in this series vary in subject matter, but are all relevant to Lou Ismay's Environmental Forum classes and environmental issues. Many of the topics relate to environmental organizations. Other folders include news clippings and information by or about individual people, such as Ralph Nader, who visited and spoke at the school in the early 1970s. Included in this series is information on the Hudson River Sloop Restoration, which contains letters written by Pete Seeger. Oversized material is filed separately.</p>
