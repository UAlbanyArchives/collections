      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Dr. Bernard Vonnegut was born in 1914 in Indianapolis, Indiana to architect Kurt Vonnegut,
        Sr. (1884-1957) and Edith Sophia Lieber (d. 1944). He had two younger siblings; a sister,
        Alice (1917-1958), and a brother, Kurt (1922-2007), the 20th Century author famous for his
        works of satire and science fiction. Bernard Vonnegut attended public elementary schools,
        Shortridge High School and the Park School which he graduated from in 1932. From there he
        attended MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his bachelor’s
        degree in Chemistry in 1936 and a doctorate in Physical Chemistry in 1939.</p>
      <p>After receiving his PhD, Vonnegut went to work for the Hartford Empire Company where he
        conducted research on surface properties and the breaking stress of glass. He worked there
        for two years before returing to MIT as a research associate. During his time as a research
        associate, Vonnegut worked in the Chemical Engineering Department as well as the Meteorology
        Department. His research in the Chemical Engineering Department focused on aerosol
        generation, filtration, and measurement while in the Meteorological Department he researched
        icing of aircrafts, the adhesion of ice, and the properties of supercooled clouds.</p>
      <p>In 1945, Vonnegut left MIT once again and went to work for GE Research Labortories. At
        first he worked in the chemistry group where he focused on the supercooling of liquid tin
        metals but then was moved to another department. In his new position, Vonnegut worked
        alongside Nobel laureate Dr. Irving Langmuir, and Vincent J. Schaefer, the original
        discoverer of cloud seeding via dry ice. With Langmuir and Schaefer, Vonnegut worked on
        cloud seeding and problems related to cloud physics as well as Project Cirrus, a weather
        modification program. Research on Project Cirrus was done in conjunction with the United
        States Signal Corps, Office of Naval Research, and the United States Air Force. General
        oversight was handled by the Department of Defense. The objective of the project was to find
        ways to artificially influence precipitation. Work on this project, as well as the science
        of artificial precipitation, was strongly influenced by Vonnegut’s discovery of AgI, Silver
        Iodide, as a superior nucleation agent. This method became the chief method of “rain
        making.” Along with his discovery of AgI as a nucleation agent, Vonnegut also devised
        intruments for measuring the true air temperature from an airplane, known as the vortex
        thermometer, and an automatic condensation nucei meter for measuring aerosols.</p>
      <p>Dr. Vonnegut left GE in 1952 for a position with the management consultant angency Arthur
        D. Little where he continued research in atmospheric science and aerosols. His atmospheric
        science research was done in partnership with Charles Moore; their work was focused on
        atmospheric electricity and cloud physics. While at Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut also
        participated in research on the problems associated with the measurement and production of
        aerosols, the miniaturization of electrical recorders, the hazards of electrostatic in
        industry, glass fiber formation, and the behavior of evaporating electrified droplets. Much
        of the reaearch and experiments that Vonnegut conducted at Arthur Little were not done
        purely for research purposes but done because of contracts the company had with public and
        private agencies.</p>
      <p>After 15 years with Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut moved on to the newly created
        Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York at Albany under the
        direction of Vincent Schaefer. Vonnegut was hired as a senior research scientist and looked
        at electrification in thunderstorms, the role of electricity in precipitation formation, and
        kinetic nucleation. Along with his research position, Vonegut also held an academic
        appointment in which he taught classes on atmospheric electricity, atmospheric
        instrumentation, and atmospheric chemistry. During his time at SUNY Albany, Vonnegut
        received several awards. In 1976, he was awarded the American Meteorological Award for
        Outstanding Contributions to the Advancement of Applied Meteoroloy. The following year, he
        recieved the Weather Modification Association Vincent J. Schaefer Award. Along with these
        awards, Vonnegut was named a Distinguished Research Professor in 1984 and, upon his formal
        retirement in 1985, was named Professor Emeritus.</p>
      <p>One of Dr. Vonnegut’s most notable projects during his time at SUNY Albany was his
        collaboration with NASA on the Night/Day Optical Survey of Lightning (NOSL) experiments.
        Astronauts, equipped with specialized recording instruments, took pictures and video of
        large thunderstorms over the course of three shuttle missions. Dr. Vonnegut, who proposed
        the project, utilized the photographs and data in his continuing research on thunderstorms
        and electrification theory.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Dr. Vonnegut pursued research in many fields of interest; mainly
        thunderclouds, tornadoes, and lightning. He made regular summer expeditions to New Mexico
        where he worked with colleagues at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in
        Socorro to study these phenomena, and many of the experiments he undertook pertain to these
        three topics. Furthermore, Dr. Vonnegut accumulated multiple patents for his inventions and
        research techniques. </p>
      <p>Dr. Vonnegut married Lois Bowler (d. 1972) and had five sons. Interestingly, after becoming
        a father, he took on a personal campaign to improve the quality of educational science texts
        and encyclopedias, as well as truth in advertising regarding scientific claims on children’s
        products.</p>
      <p>Dr. Vonnegut continued atmospheric research and publishing until his death from cancer at
        82 in 1997.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Dr. Vonnegut's papers chronicle his professional career as an atmospheric scientist at MIT,
        the GE Research Laboratories, Arthur D. Little Corporation, and the State University of New
        York at Albany's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center and Department of Atmospheric
        Sciences. The collection spans from 1828 his death in 1997. The earliest materials in the
        collection are reprints of articles that he referenced for his research.</p>
      <p>The records in this collection document Dr. Vonnegut's research interests. These interests
        include icing and atmospheric electricity, cloud physics, thunderstorms, and tornado
        formation. The collection also contain extensive information about his major scientific
        discoveries and experiments, such as Project Cirrus, a program that sought ways to
        artificially influence precipitation, the NASA/NOSL project where he studied weather
        phenomena from space, and his experiments and research in New Mexico. Additionally, a small
        amount of personal records are interspersed in the collection.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged into 11 series. The records consist of technical memoranda,
        research, data, inventions and patent forms, equipment specifications, drawings, figures,
        handwritten notes, manuscripts, reports, correspondence, publicity materials, course
        materials, news clippings, photographs, memorabilia, and audio/video materials. The majority
        of materials date from Dr. Vonnegut’s tenure at GE, Arthur D. Little, and State University
        of New York at Albany.</p>
      <p>All series are arranged alphabetically and reflect Dr. Vonnegut's own filing system. Since
        the original order was maintained, correspondence is kept with other materials, such as
        reports and technical memorandum, when they were found together. If the correspondence was
        found in a seperate place than the materials it was originally meant to be paired with,
        there was not an effort to reunite the materials. Copies of reports and memorandum may be
        found in multiple locations.</p>

          <p>Series 2 documents the NOSL (Nighttime/Daylight Optical Survey of Thunderstorm
            Lightning) experiment, a large-scale project undertaken by NASA during the early 1980s,
            in which astronauts recorded and documented thunderstorm and lightning activity from the
            Earth’s orbit. Dr. Vonnegut, who proposed the project, utilized the photographs and data
            in his continuing research on thunderstorms and electrification theory.</p>
          <p>The series contains data, reports, correspondence, press releases, photographs, and
            NASA technical memoranda and shuttle specifications regarding the NOSL project. Crew
            activity plans and specifications are filed by flight number. Associated documents were
            kept with their respective flight number as much as possible. Additionally, memorabilia
            from one shuttle flight is incorporated, including a signed photograph from the
            astronauts who took part in the experiment.</p>

          <p>While employed at Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut built upon his research in atmospheric
            science. The majority of his work focused on electrification of clouds, thunderstorms,
            and the behavior of lightning, he also looked at behaviors of gases but on a much
            smaller scale. Besides pursuing his own research, Dr. Vonnegut worked on a number of
            advisory projects for the United States government. These projects focused on the
            relationship between aircrafts and lightning. The main focus was on how aircrafts detect
            and avoid lightning when flying in a storm.</p>
          <p>The series contains data, reports, correspondence, press releases, photographs,
            newspaper clippings, drawings, figures, and handwritten notes. The arrangement reflects
            Dr. Vonnegut’s original filing system. Materials are first filed by item type and then
            by subject. In cases where different types of materials were filed together, Dr.
            Vonnegut’s arrangement was maintained to reflect how he used and viewed the materials.
            This is most prevalent in correspondence files. Correspondence is sometimes paired with
            clippings or reports. If the correspondence was separated from the items it was
            originally paired with, the archivist maintained this arrangement. </p>

          <p>Series 4 documents Dr. Vonnegut’s work with the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
            Technology (NMIMT) in Socorro, New Mexico. While both were employed at Arthur D. Little,
            he and fellow scientist Charles Moore were invited to conduct thunderstorm research at
            Mt. Withington, eventually becoming part of the Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric
            Research in Socorro. Moore stayed at NMIMT, and Dr. Vonnegut moved on to the State
            University of New York at Albany; though their collaborative research continued for the
            entirety of each other’s career.</p>
          <p>The series includes a large amount of correspondence with Charles Moore, as well as
            with other prominent figures related to NMIMT; Marx Brook, Stirling Colgate, and William
            Winn. This series also consists of data, research, and articles regarding experiments in
            New Mexico.</p>

          <p>This series consists primarily of tornado observations and eyewitness accounts
            solicited from the general public via newspaper advertisements in areas where tornadoes
            and severe storms frequently occur. They are filed using the original labeling system
            employed by Dr. Vonnegut, where the date and place of the observation as well as a brief
            statement on the phenomena is used to identify the observation. Accounts of severe
            storms found in multiple publications, biblical references, and other historical
            observations are also present. </p>
          <p>Please note that the archivist filed all of the loose photographs together. The
            archivist kept any photograph accompanying observation, research, or data with that
            respective material.</p>

          <p>Series 6 contains Dr. Vonnegut’s general interest and research files, as well as the
            inventions that he worked on throughout his career. Topics include: lightning, ball
            lightning, lightning strikes and the effect on aircraft, volcanic activity and storms on
            Mt. St. Helens and Surtsey, thunderstorm electrification, and weather-related
            instruments.</p>
          <p>A large quantity of photographs dominates the series. Please note that the archivist
            filed all loose photographs together. Many photographs are undated with no
            specifications on location or activity depicted. The archivist kept any photograph
            accompanying research or data with its respective material.</p>

          <p>Series 8 documents the work that Dr. Vonnegut did while employed at SUNY Albany. During
            his time at SUNY Albany, Dr. Vonnegut taught classes, served on committees, attended
            conferences, and continued his research concerning weather, lightning, and clouds. Much
            of the research that Dr. Vonnegut did while at SUNY Albany was done as part of
            government research projects. Most notable was his work on Project Themis which was conducted
            by the United States Air Force. The project's main focus was on the modification and structure of 
            clouds and fog but also investigated other areas of research such as raindrop dynamics and
            atmospheric electrical phenomena </p>
          <p>Included in this series are flyers, pamphlets, photographs, reports, project proposals,
            correspondence, travel arrangements, purchasing requests, conference programs, meeting
            agendas, press releases, newspaper and magazine clippings, handwritten notes, drawings,
            figures, and materials related to classes Dr. Vonnegut taught. Class materials include
            lists of students as well as tests and grades students received. Materials with personal
            information about students are restricted.</p>
