      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The Laborers' International Union of North America was formed in April 1903 
as the International Hod Carriers' and Building Laborers' Union of America from 
twenty-five delegates representing seventeen cities and over 8,000 laborers. 
By the late 1920s, a construction boom and the addition of three amalgamations 
added to the union's size: the International Compressed Air and Foundation Workers 
Union; the Tunnel and Subway Constructors International Union; and the 
International Union of Pavers, Rammemen, Flag Layers, Bridge and Curb Setters 
and Sheet Asphalt Pavers.  In 1955, the union affiliated with the AFL-CIO 
Industrial Union Department in order to represent the 60,000 laborers working 
under the jurisdiction of the IUD.  After the post-World War II boom, the union 
also began representing non-construction workers.  In 1965, the union officially 
changed its name to the Laborers' International Union of North America to reflect 
its continued growth beyond the construction field.  Local 157 was chartered in 1912 and represented 
laborers in Schenectady, New York and surrounding communities in the building 
trades. The local's early members were primarily Italian American.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Laborers' International Union of North America, Local 157 records 
primarily document the union's activities for the period 1937-1972 through 
correspondence and meeting minutes.  All of the records are photocopies of the 
original documents.  The records provide an account of routine operations by 
Local 157 including negotiations with employers in Schenectady, grievances, 
elections, as well as financial and membership records.  The union's early members 
were predominantly Italian American, which means the membership lists 
of 1912-1914 are in Italian.  The correspondence includes material specific to Local 157 as well 
as items from the national office having to do with legislation and other 
national issues.  Included with the correspondence and meeting minutes are 
sporadic membership and officer lists.</p>
