      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Gerald B. H. Solomon  Papers contain records that documents his career as a Republican representing the 22nd District of New York, 1979-1999. Of particular interest are the numerous ""Black Books"" containing detailed summary information pertaining to Solomon's legislative activities, including his voting activity and the justification for his vote, bills and resolutions he introduced, and legislation and resolutions he cosponsored by him. Also of interest are the Floor Statements, Remarks, and Extensions made by Solomon. Solomon kept most of the House Resolutions voted on during the later half of his career, which are represented in the collection.  He also served as a member of the New York State Assembly from 1973-1978.</p>
