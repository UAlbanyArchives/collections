      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>This Conference was originally organized in 1918 as the Empire Typographical Conference. On August 25, 1918, representatives from eight printers' locals met at Syracuse, New York, to discuss the formation of a New York State Conference for union printers. A month later on September 28, 1918, twelve locals were represented at the first official conference, during which the Conference's constitution was prepared. The objects of the Conference were to improve the employment and wages of union printers, to organize local typographical unions, to provide a forum for printers' unions to discuss common problems, and to promote the ideals of the International Typographical Union in particular and unionism in general.</p>
      <p>In 1972 the Conference changed its name to the Empire Typographcical and Mailer Conference to recognize the contribution of the member mailers' unions. The members of this body hold biannual conferences in the spring and fall. In 1986 the International Typographical Union merged into the Communications Workers of America (CWA), and hence the Empire Typographical and Mailer Conference has been a subordinate to this union. (Shiesley, Stanley E. "History of the Empire Typographical and Mailer Conference." 122nd Semi-Annual Empire Typographical and Mailer Conference, Binghamton, New York, Local 232, October 26, 27, 28, 1979.)</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The proceedings of the semi-annual conferences (1934, 1938-75) are the most helpful of these records. Each attending local gave a presentation on the state of its affairs, and this information is printed for each conference. However, 1975 was the last year for which the Conference printed its proceedings. Conferences retain their semi-annual schedule, but interest and attendance at the local has been encouraged by ensuring that these are the only ways to learn about what is happening in the state's printers' unions. For the early years of the Conference, the bulletins (1919-20, 1930, 1935-36, 1938) document the activities of the member locals. For the most part, the bulletins give information identical in type to that of the proceedings. The bulletins, however, were designed to be posted in union halls and workplaces so that rank and file members would have easy access to the information. </p>
      <p>There is little information on the Conference since 1975. The only record the conference makes of its activities is in its official calls to conference (1983, 1985-88, 1990). These calls give little information besides the dates and place of conferences, and since 1983 all conferences have been held in Syracuse (a central location in New York State) unless another local makes a bid to host the conference.</p>
