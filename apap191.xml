      <abstract label="Abstract:"> The Thomas Nattell papers document the life of a mental health
        worker and political activist active during the 1980s and 1990s in Albany, New York. He
        created and participated in organizations like the Albany Peace and Energy Council (APEC)
        and the Three Guys From Albany poetry troupe. He also acted as promoter and event
        coordinator for movie showings, poetry open mics and an annual 24-hour poetry reading
        alongside a coinciding international postcard art event. Nattell used poetry and other arts
        to advance world peace, anti-nuclear power and proliferation, and environmental issues. This
        collection contains videos of events, photographs, scrapbooks full of art and poetry mailed
        from around the world to Nattell, subject files with research on topics related to his
        professional work as well as his activism, poetry, correspondence, and clippings.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Thomas "Tom" Cole Nattell was born in 1950. He lived his life entirely in Albany, New York
        aside from a short period during his childhood. He received a B.A. in Anthropology in 1974,
        a M.A. in Anthropology in 1976 and a M.S.W. in 1979 all from the State University of New
        York at Albany. He worked as a research associate for the New York State Council on Children
        and Families and other positions until settling in 1988 at the New York State Office of
        Mental Health (NYS OMH) as a program coordinator and as a Research Scientist III until the
        end of his life. </p>
      <p>Nattell was widely known as a poet and environmentalist. His activism dates back to the
        1960s, when he started a sit-in at Albany High School gymnasium demanding a Black Studies
        program. He used poetry and protest gatherings to support issues including AIDS awareness,
        environmentalism, anti-nuclear proliferation, Native American rights and pacifism. He was a
        member of many organizations apart from his work at the NYS OMH. Nattell was a founding
        member of the Capital District Anti-Nuclear Alliance (CDANA) which later became the Albany
        Peace and Energy Council (APEC), a member of the poetry group “Three Guys from Albany,” a
        promoter and events coordinator for performances by the Bread and Puppet Circus. Nattell
        promoted other events, including readings at the New York State Writers Institute, and
        founded Open Mic poetry nights at the now-closed QE2 club on Central Avenue in Albany, New
        York. He created an annual 24-hour poetry reading and APEC fund-raiser that occurred for a
        decade called the “Readings Against the End of the World” (RAEW). Nattell authored many
        letters to the editor and was a frequent commentator on local issues in regional newspapers
        like the Albany <emph render="italic">Times Union</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Knickerbocker News</emph>, and eventually wrote his own column called "The Simple Life"
        in the alternative news weekly magazine <emph render="italic">Metroland</emph>.</p>
      <p>Nattell died at age 52 in 2005 of throat cancer, survived by his long time friend and
        partner Mary Anne Winslow, a son and daughter and two brothers.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection contains videos of events, photographs, scrapbooks full of art and poetry
        mailed from around the world to Nattell for display during events, subject files with
        research on topics related to his professional work as well as his activism, poetry,
        correspondence with politicians, business owners and poets, resumes, magazines, promotional
        material, and more. While Nattell was widely known as a poet, only a few samples of his
        poetry are present in the collection: “Hiroshima” and the “Columbus Day fantasies”. This
        collection provides insight into day-to-day life of a mental health coordinator, event
        organization in Albany, activism and event coverage in the media, and the early “green”
        environmentalist movement. It features correspondence with prominent individuals such as
        poets Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman, as well as Albany Mayor Thomas M Whalen III. The
        collection also contains information on CDANA/APEC, a small 501 (c) council with many
        official newsletters and press releases regarding environmental and political causes. </p>

          <p>Nattell was a founding member of the political, economic and social activist groups
            CDANA/APEC. The group was originally called the Capital District Anti-Nuclear Alliance
            but at a meeting on January 18, 1982 changed the name to APEC to better reflect the
            organization’s expanding areas of interest. This series contains many copies of the
            quarterly newsletter released by CDANA/APEC as well as the original publication galley
            proofs that were photocopied for the newsletter. Also included are newspaper clippings,
            article drafts, and galleys for tickets to events related to CDANA/APEC.</p>
