      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>In the summer of 1971 planning for a reorganizing of the downtown campus began. With the near completion of the Uptown campus, the downtown one was targeted as the campus population grew and accommodations had to be made. It was felt that that the interiors of the buildings needed to be refurbished to suit the modern times. The Task Force also wanted to reform the structure of campus by creating more evening classes for adults. There was also a goal of shortening the time it takes to earn a bachelorâ€™s degree down to three years from four. This was referred to as "Collins College" named after the former president of the University Evan R. Collins.
Not all of the recommendations made by the Task Force were seen through. Based on the ones found in meeting minutes and reports this task force played an important role in the further development of the State University at Albany. The Task Force was only active during the early 1970s as the records span 1970 to 1972. It was also referred to as the Planning Task Force in many documents.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains materials created by the Task Force for Planning Downtown Campus. The items document meetings and proposals made by the Task Force. These include changes to class and degree earning structure, reorganizing and refurbishment of the downtown campus, and expansion of campus buildings to gain more space for key parts of the university. The documents include proposals, meeting minutes, responses to proposals from upper University administration, and correspondence with companies for planning these changes. There is little evidence of the implementation of these changes and most documents cover planning and proposals.</p>
