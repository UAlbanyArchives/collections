      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>English language and literature instruction at the University dates back to the founding of the New York State Normal School in 1844. The M.A. in English was first offered in 1962, and a Ph.D. was offered the following year. A Doctor of Arts in English was introduced in 1971, intended for students preparing for a career in teaching, rather than research. The D.A. program was discontinued in 1995. Currently, the Department of English offers a B.A., an Honors B.A., a combined B.A./M.A., several minors, and graduate work leading to an M.A. or Ph.D.</p>
