      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Preservation League of New York State was incorporated in March 1974. The organization encourages the preservation of historic buildings, districts, and landscapes in New York State. It was responsible for saving the outbuildings of Camp Sagamore, an Adirondack Great Camp built in 1895, through a popular referendum. It also worked for the New York State Historic Preservation Act, fought off a bill to exempt historic religious properties from law, and lobbied the National Park Service for suitable development of buildings on the south side of Ellis Island. </p>
