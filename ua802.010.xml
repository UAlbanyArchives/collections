      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Roger Conant, a graduate student in the Department of History, met Vasiliki "Vicki" Gekas
        when he arrived at the University at Albany in the 1970 winter semester. Both lived in
        Brubacher Hall, the graduate student dormitory on Alumni Quad. Born in Greece, Gekas
        emigrated to Rochester, NY as a child. She received her bachelor of arts degree from the
        University at Albany in 1969 and returned for graduate studies. Both she and Conant received
        master of arts degrees from the University in 1972.</p>
      <p>Gekas was the inspiration for the main character in <title><emph render="italic">Las Isla
            de los Jacinto Cortados (The Island of the Cut Hyacinths)</emph></title> (1980) by
        award-winning Spanish novelist Gonzalo Torrente Ballester. Torrente Ballester joined the
        Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University at Albany in 1966 and
        remained until 1972. During this period, he met Gekas and later wrote about her in the novel
        which is partially set on and near the University at Albany campus, features some real
        professors and other students (some named, some with pseudonyms) and focuses on a love
        triangle.</p>
      <p>Today Conant is a historian and filmmaker specializing in the cultural heritage of East
        Central Europe. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This small collection contains photographs of Vicki Gekas retained by Roger Conant and
        correspondence from Gekas to Conant while both were students at the University at Albany.
        Five of the photographs of Gekas were taken in Brubacher Hall during an April 1971
        celebration on International Students' Night. A sixth (digital image only) is from an April
        1971 campus protest seeking an end to United States support of the Greek military junta.</p>
      <p>For additional materials about Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, please see the Gonzalo Torrente
        Ballester Papers (MSS-029). Additional photographs of student activities are found in
        University Archives.</p>
