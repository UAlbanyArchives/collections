      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p> Ralph F. Boyd, Sr. is a lifelong social justice advocate well known for his commitment to
        civil rights, equality, civil service and local community activism within Schenectady, New
        York. Born in 1919 in Norfolk, V.A, and raised in Baltimore M.D, Boyd grew up in the
        segregated south during a time when discrimination and racism plagued many northern and
        southern communities. Although there were occasional hardships, the support and importance
        of family, along with the community of church, acted as Boyd’s savior. He credits both
        components for instilling strong moral values within him. </p>
      <p> Upon graduating from Frederick Douglass High School, Boyd continued his education by
        attending Morgan College, now Morgan State University, in Baltimore. He was able to complete
        two years before World War II disrupted his college life. While serving in the U.S. Army, he
        was part of the all black (segregated) 366 Infantry Regiment that would later go on to be
        recognized and honored for its performance during the war. </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that Boyd, and many other African-Americans, were willing to fight in the
        war for the cause of democracy and protection of their country, the reception these skilled
        veterans received upon returning home was not a welcoming one. Boyd returned home, realized
        that nothing had changed and was concerned. </p>
      <p> Discontented with the status quo of society, following the war efforts abroad, Boyd
        decided that he would work to effect change. His first target would be the General Electric
        Co., a company which previously denied him employment when he first inquired about a job
        soon after the war. Boyd was told that he didn’t have the training to fulfill a position
        within the company in spite of his skilled experience in the U.S. Army. General Electric
        eventually began to hire African-Americans in 1948, including Boyd, but this would not be
        the end of the trouble that Boyd would endure, nor would it be the end of other problems
        that he noticed. Not only were African-Americans being treated unfairly, women were being
        treated unequally as well. Boyd began to defend his female co-workers who were not being
        paid the same as the men. Despite the obstacles placed forth, Boyd remained within General
        Electric. He would eventually become a prominent spokesperson and leader for the
        International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers (IUE)
        Local 301 union as well as the foreman in the Turbine-Generator Department. He continued
        working for General Electric for 34 years, up until his retirement in 1982.</p>
      <p>In addition to campaigning for change within General Electric, Ralph Boyd also worked
        within the local community of Schenectady to advocate change for the social, political and
        economic conditions for African-Americans. Noted for his local community activism, he was
        elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Possessing both the
        passion and eagerness to see everybody within society treated equally, alongside his
        interest in community activities, Boyd, in company with friends and colleagues, established
        and developed the Schenectady chapter of the NAACP in 1950. Serving as the chapter’s
        president for several terms, in addition to undertaking the responsibility of each post
        within the organization during his years of involvement, Boyd promoted and supported
        initiatives for reform change in areas surrounding the housing “slums” within Schenectady.
        These initiatives include, but were not limited to, acquiring affordable housing for low
        income groups and improving the conditions within the slums to make the surroundings
        acceptable for proper living. In addition to his focus on housing, Boyd also campaigned for
        equality within education and was instrumental in the establishment of the Baptist
        Retirement Center in 1977. The Baptist Retirement Center, which is located in Scotia, New
        York, provides activities and medical care for seniors and is the result of Boyd’s desire to
        see a nursing home within the local community that would facilitate care for those elderly
        in need.</p>
      <p>As a social justice advocate, Ralph Boyd’s work within the Schenectady community is both
        acknowledged and highly praised. He has won numerous awards, one which identified him as a
        Schenectady Patroon in 2008, an award that is the city’s equivalent to the Nobel Prize.
        General Electric named him a winner of the Gerald L. Phillippe Award for Distinguished
        Public Service in 1978.</p>
