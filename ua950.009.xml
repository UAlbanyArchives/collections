      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Carillon began publication in 1967, naming itself after the tower on the still newly built campus. It was a school newspaper detailing events on campus such as newly appointed faculty, sporting events, and alumni news. It was published by the Alumni Association. In the Spring of 1987 the University at Albany Magazine began publishing. The content was similar, focusing on campus events, giving alumni spotlights. It was published seasonally in the Fall, Winter, and Spring. The magazine was originally published by the University Relations Office. </p>
      <p> In the Spring of 1992 the two publication combined being renamed the University at Albany Magazine, with The Carillon. The publication was larger, once again containing similar content as previously, and also contained information on research at the university, discussing the work of faculty. This continued this way until the Fall of 2000 when the title returned to being the University at Albany Magazine. The carillon was still in the publication, typically taking up the second half and consisting of alumni news and notes. The target of both these publications is Alumni, parents, and faculty of the University.</p>
