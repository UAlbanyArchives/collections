      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The National Association of Black Social Workers, Capital District Chapter was formally organized
	  in Fall 1972 in Albany, New York. The National Association of Black Social Workers, Inc. (NABSW) was
	  established in San Francisco in 1968 when a group of social workers attending a meeting of an established
	  national social work organization disengaged from those meetings to form what would become the foremost
	  advocacy group established to address social issues of concern in the African American community. The
	  NABSW is designed to promote the welfare, survival and liberation of the African American community and
	  advocates at a national, state and local level for social change. Headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, the
	  organization is made up of over 100 member chapters throughout the continental United States and the Caribbean,
	  with affiliate Groups in West and South Africa. Membership is available to persons of African ancestry who,
	  regardless of profession, share similar concerns regarding health and welfare issues in the Black community.
	  NABSW has over 30 student chapters at graduate schools of social work throughout the country. NABSW hosts an
	  annual National and International Conference open to its membership and potential members.</p>
      <p>Jerry Blanton was President of the Albany Chapter of the Northeastern Capital District Association of Black
	  Social Workers in the early 1970s and described three goals for the organization. These goals included working
	  with established organizations to unite the community, making the expertise of members available to the community,
	  and accepting Agency Board Memberships throughout the area to enhance the better delivery of services to the community.
	  This organization affiliated itself with the NABSW in 1972. The Chapter was also known as the Albany, New York Chapter
	  of the National Association of Black Social Workers. The Chapter was apparently inactive for an unknown period of time
	  in the 1970s and early 1980s before being revived in August 1983 by Deloris Kirkwood Brown. The organization sponsored
	  workshops for its members as well as members of the community.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of the National Association of Black Social Workers, Capital District Chapter primarily document the
	  organization's history in the early 1970s and the early 1980s. The organization's founding is well documented by meeting
	  minutes, correspondence, and its constitution. The most complete documentation of the organization is for the years
	  1971-1972. The collection includes sporadic coverage of membership lists, legislative issues of interest to the
	  organization, and programs organized by the group. The collection also includes single copies of the Association of
	  Black Social Workers (ABSW) newsletter, the NABSW newsletter, and <emph render="italic">Black Caucus the Journal of the
	  National Association of Black Social Workers.</emph></p>
