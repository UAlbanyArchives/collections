      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP) is the largest national organization exclusively devoted to abolishing the death penalty. The NCADP provides information, advocates for public policy, and mobilizes and supports individuals and institutions which reject the use of capital punishment. Through these methods the NCADP hopes to eliminate the death penalty in the United States and supports efforts to abolish the death penalty worldwide.</p>
      <p>The NCADP was founded in 1976 following the <emph render="italic">Gregg v. Georgia</emph> Supreme Court decision, which reinstated the death penalty in the United States. Two American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) staff members, Deborah Leavy and Henry Schwarzchild, gathered a group of anti-capital punishment advocates one week after the <emph render="italic">Gregg</emph> decision. The organization that resulted brought together 26 affiliate organizations to coordinate their actions at the national level. The NCADP began its life housed within the ACLU offices in New York. Shortly after 1982 the group relocated to Philadelphia and, in 1987, moved to its current location in Washington D.C.</p>
      <p>As a Washington based advocacy group, the NCADP lobbies against capital punishment through a variety of methods that include organizing protests and increasing public awareness. The NCADP uses a number of non-violent methods to draw attention to, and advance, their campaign at local, state and national levels.</p>
      <p>Since its inception, the NCADP has been working to educate and inform the public about the failings and inconsistencies of the death penalty. The NCADP’s campaign against capital punishment hinges on four core areas of advocacy: legislative, media, grassroots, and human rights. These efforts are accomplished through an annual conference, distribution of national publications such as <emph render="italic">LifeLines</emph>, the newsletter of the NCADP, and the <emph render="italic">National Execution Alert Network</emph>, a system which provides updates on pending executions.  Founded in 1984, the Alert Network is a tracking and warning project keyed to executions – directing when and what actions should be taken in protest.  Since 1981, the NCADP has hosted an annual conference which brings abolitionists from across the country together to analyze the past years successes and shortcomings and to strategize the goals and objectives for the coming year. Additionally, the NCADP compiles statistics and publishes findings on a variety of subjects concerning the death penalty including <emph render="italic">The Abolitionist Directory</emph>, a national listing of every organization and individual working against capital punishment and <emph render="italic">The Death Penalty Exchange</emph>, a handbook for organizers.</p>
      <p>The NCADP has achieved recent victories in its struggle to end capital punishment.  Through the efforts of its <emph render="italic">Stop Killing Kids Campaign</emph>, an initiative that sought to bring an end to the death penalty for offenders whose crimes were committed while they were under the age of 18, NCADP was successful in ending the death penalty as punishment for juveniles in several states.  In 2006 NCADP successfully fought death penalty reinstatement efforts in Wisconsin, and the group has played a significant role in winning clemency for several death row inmates.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty Records documents the administration, avocation, and lobbying activities of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty from 1976 to 2001.</p>
      <p>The largest portion of the collection contains the NCADP’s internal case files. These are divided into Adult, Juvenile, and Innocence sub series comprised of folders which represent an individual capital case. Each file contains trial proceedings, news clippings, artwork, death warrants, and correspondence between the NCADP and death row inmates, government officials, and various affiliate organizations.</p>
      <p>The NCADP Records also contain the group’s publications, materials gathered from conferences, photographs, audio and video material, and signed petitions from the <emph render="italic">Stop Killing Kids</emph> campaign against the death penalty for juveniles.</p>
      <p>The Subject Files series contains research material related to the various aspects of the death penalty but with a focus on education.  Folders include material on death penalty law in the United States and abroad.  Folders in this series contain articles, correspondence, news clippings, photographs, press releases, statements, and reports.  Topics covered include advocacy, discrimination, families, juveniles, medical issues, and other aspects of death penalty law.  This series also includes material from several affiliate organizations.</p>
