      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p> Paul Bruce Pettit (1920-1972) was a professor of theatre and the first chair of the
        Department of Theatre at the University at Albany, 1947-1972. </p>
      <p> Pettit was born in Greensburg, Indiana, on July 9, 1920. After completing high school at
        The Principia in Saint Louis, Missouri, he attended and received a Bachelor of Arts (1942)
        in English from Alfred University in Alfred, New York. Immediately following his graduation
        Pettit enrolled in graduate school at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he
        became involved in the vibrant theatre arts community. Pettit earned a Master of Arts (1943)
        and a Doctor of Philosophy (1949) from Cornell. </p>
      <p>Though their marriage did not last, E. Bernice "Bunny" Pettit (nee Minkler) was
        very involved in Dr. Pettit's professional life while they were together, often
        collaborating on projects or accompanying him to events. She also mothered their two
        children, Alexander Drummond and Faith Caldwell Pettit. </p>
      <p> Dr. Pettit was appointed to the faculty at New York State College for Teachers in 1947 in
        the combined English and Dramatic Arts Department and remained employed at the institution
        until his death. After the college became the State University of New York at Albany, he was
        instrumental in the forming of the Department of Speech and Dramatic Arts and fostered the
        evolution into the Department of Theatre which he initially chaired. As a professor of
        theatre, he was actively involved in the American Educational Theatre Association (AETA).
        After returning from a Fulbright Scholarship in Greece (1950-51) where he directed the
        Athens Players, and with a renewed interest in arena theater, Pettit founded the Arena
        Summer Theatre at the university in 1952. Dr. Pettit traveled extensively, particularly in
        the Mediterranean, on various grants and Fulbright Scholarships. In 1964 Dr. Pettit and his
        family were among hundreds of Americans evacuated from the strife-torn island of Cyprus
        during the escalating Greek-Turkish conflicts. Until the struggle made his work there
        impossible, Dr. Pettit had served as American advisor and director of the Greek-Cypriot
        National Theatre in Nicosia, Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Drawing on his cultural background, Dr. Pettit was often called on to contribute to the
        surrounding community as a subject expert. From 1947-1949, WROW radio featured Dr. Pettit as
        an entertainment critic. He provided a start-up for Albany Civic Theater and served as
        president of the Albany League of Arts working directly with the New York State Council on
        the Arts. In his capacity as president of the Albany League of Arts, Dr. Pettit proposed and
        advocated for the building of a Cultural Arts Center for the City of Albany.</p>
      <p>In 1971, while on leave from the university, Dr. Pettit served as Visiting University
        Fellow and director of program development in the fine arts for the newly established Empire
        State College. Prior to returning to his teaching post at the university in 1972, Dr. Pettit
        died of a heart attack in his home. He was 52 years old.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection documents Dr. Paul Bruce Pettit's professional life as a researcher, professor, and
        arts administrator. Materials in the collection include folders that contain correspondence,
        academic papers and other samplings of work that Dr. Pettit produced while enrolled in graduate
        programs (M.A. and Ph.D.) at Cornell University, 1942-43 and 1947-49 respectively. Besides
        three bound copies of printed scripts from his radio broadcasts of theatrical reviews,
        1947-1948, there are also copies of his master's thesis and doctoral dissertation, <emph render="italic">The Important American Dramatic Types to 1900: A Study of the Yankee,
          Negro, Indian, and Frontiersman</emph>, 1949.</p>
      <p>Correspondence, offprints of articles about theater related subjects, plays and reviews,
        and lecture notes from Dr. Pettit's tenure as a professor of theatre at the University at
        Albany (known as New York State College for Teachers at the time of hire) are also part of
        the collection, 1947-72. </p>
      <p>Additionally, there is material from within this time frame that includes a bound copy of
        his play <emph render="italic">A Night from a Thousand Nights and a Night</emph> translated
        into Arabic, and presented while directing the National Theatre in Cyprus as part of a
        Fulbright scholarship, 1964-1965. Writings in the collection from the era and clippings give
        an account of Dr. Pettit's and other Americans evacuation from Cyprus when a Turkish
        invasion appeared eminent. There are other newspaper clippings chronicling Dr. Pettit's
        accomplishments throughout his life. </p>
      <p>The majority of the file names are names that Dr. Pettit assigned them based on handwritten or
        typed labels the archivist found on the original folders in the collection. If there was no
        label indicating the file's name, the archivist chose a name based on the subject of
        the records. All the files are arranged chronologically. Within the files, items are
        arranged based on the year of their creation. </p>
      <p>Related collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives
        include the records of the Department of Theatre (UA-609) and the Jarka M. Burian Papers,
        (UA-902.017). </p>
