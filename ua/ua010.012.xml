    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In 1971 New York State decided to begin breaking down the state into educational regions, each overseen by a representative of the State Education Department. The University at Albany responded to this by creating a Task Force to help comply with new changes and oversight brought about by Regionalization. This was also supposed to lead for more cooperation among regional institutions. SUNY Albany responded to this  particular request by upgrading their computer's capabilities to help facilitate communication. The Task Force was supposed to operate until 1976 when regionalization would have been completed, but there is not evidence of their existence after 1972.</p>  </bioghist>
