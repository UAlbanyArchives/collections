    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>University Photo Service is a student group that produced photographs of campus events. Founded in 1963, the group provides photographic equipment and darkroom services to its members in exchange for documenting campus events. From its foundation until 2014, University Photo Service also produced the Torch Yearbook. As of 2019, Photographic Services has maintained an office in the Campus Center for more than 50 years.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection is made up of photographic negatives (primarily in 35mm and 6x7 formats), contact sheets and photographic prints (primarily in 5"x8" and 8"x10" sizes). Many of the photographs have been placed into folders, though there are also  binders of photographic prints in this collection as well.  As the University Photo Service was responsible for producing the Torch yearbook until 2014, many prints and negatives of photographs that appeared in the Torch can be found in this collection. The photographs document life and events on and around campus. Student dorm life, athletic events, campus visits by dignitaries, faculty portraits, graduations and building dedications are among the subjects of these photographs.</p>  </scopecontent>
