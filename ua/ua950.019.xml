    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Alumni Association began publishing the Alumni Directory in 1980 as a way to help keep graduates of the University at Albany connected. Being included in the book was a voluntary. Up until 2006 invovlement in the book was pretty broad, though it is obvious that for the 2011 edition there was a drop in numbers of alumni offering their invovlement. It has since been replaced by social media sites such as Facebook and Linkedin, of which the Alumni associaiotn has its own personal pages for. There are also some other tools such as a map of the numbers of Albany graduates from various counties around the country.</p>  </bioghist>
