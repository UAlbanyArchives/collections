    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>UAlbany has produced a number of different publications throughout its history targeted at members of the faculty. From 1952 to 2006, the Office of University Relations and its predecessors produced a series of publications aimed at keeping members of the faculty informed of campus events, university news, outside press coverage of the University, and faculty activities and publications. While these publications went by different titles over the years, the universityâ€™s faculty and staff were always the primary audience.</p><p>The <i>Faculty Bulletin of Information</i> (FBI) was a weekly general interest newsletter of campus and faculty activity published by Elmer Matthews of the Placement Office until 1964 November.  After this date publication was taken over by the Public Relations Office.  The <i>FBI</i> was succeeded by <i>Campus Courier</i> (1966-1969). Following the Campus Courier were the <i>Tower Tribune</i>, the <i>University News</i>, and the <i>University Update</i>. The <i>University Update</i> appears to have ceased publication in May of 2006.</p>  </bioghist>
