<p>Students and Faculty affiliated with the University have served in the American military going back to the Mexican-American War. Begun in 1999, the Alumni Relations Office began an ongoing project seeking to recognize members of the University at Albany community who had served in the military with a Wall of Honor in the Science Library. The Wall was unveiled as part of Alumni Weekend in 2001.</p>  </bioghist>
