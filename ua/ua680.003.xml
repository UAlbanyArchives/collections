The PSWP works to identify emerging professional development needs and deliver workshops to meet these needs for New York State Employees in seven categories: accounting and auditing; education and research; engineering, transportation, and environment; health care; information technology; law/criminal justice; and social work and counseling.</p>  </bioghist>
