    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Dr. Bernard Vonnegut was born in 1914 in Indianapolis, Indiana to architect Kurt Vonnegut, Sr. (1884-1957) and Edith Sophia Lieber (d. 1944). He had two younger siblings; a sister, Alice (1917-1958), and a brother, Kurt (1922-2007), the 20th Century author famous for his works of satire and science fiction. Bernard Vonnegut attended public elementary schools, Shortridge High School and the Park School which he graduated from in 1932. From there he attended MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his bachelor's degree in Chemistry in 1936 and a doctorate in Physical Chemistry in 1939.</p><p> After receiving his PhD, Vonnegut went to work for the Hartford Empire Company where he conducted research on surface properties and the breaking stress of glass. He worked there for two years before returing to MIT as a research associate. During his time as a research associate, Vonnegut worked in the Chemical Engineering Department as well as the Meteorology Department. His research in the Chemical Engineering Department focused on aerosol generation, filtration, and measurement while in the Meteorological Department he researched icing of aircrafts, the adhesion of ice, and the properties of supercooled clouds.</p><p> In 1945, Vonnegut left MIT once again and went to work for GE Research Labortories. At first he worked in the chemistry group where he focused on the supercooling of liquid tin metals but then was moved to another department. In his new position, Vonnegut worked alongside Nobel laureate Dr. Irving Langmuir, and Vincent J. Schaefer, the original discoverer of cloud seeding via dry ice. With Langmuir and Schaefer, Vonnegut worked on cloud seeding and problems related to cloud physics as well as Project Cirrus, a weather modification program. Research on Project Cirrus was done in conjunction with the United States Signal Corps, Office of Naval Research, and the United States Air Force. General oversight was handled by the Department of Defense. The objective of the project was to find ways to artificially influence precipitation. Work on this project, as well as the science of artificial precipitation, was strongly influenced by Vonnegut's discovery of AgI, Silver Iodide, as a superior nucleation agent. This method became the chief method of "rain making." Along with his discovery of AgI as a nucleation agent, Vonnegut also devised intruments for measuring the true air temperature from an airplane, known as the vortex thermometer, and an automatic condensation nucei meter for measuring aerosols.</p><p> Dr. Vonnegut left GE in 1952 for a position with the management consultant angency Arthur D. Little where he continued research in atmospheric science and aerosols. His atmospheric science research was done in partnership with Charles Moore; their work was focused on atmospheric electricity and cloud physics. While at Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut also participated in research on the problems associated with the measurement and production of aerosols, the miniaturization of electrical recorders, the hazards of electrostatic in industry, glass fiber formation, and the behavior of evaporating electrified droplets. Much of the reaearch and experiments that Vonnegut conducted at Arthur Little were not done purely for research purposes but done because of contracts the company had with public and private agencies.</p><p> After 15 years with Arthur D. Little, Dr. Vonnegut moved on to the newly created Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York at Albany under the direction of Vincent Schaefer. Vonnegut was hired as a senior research scientist and looked at electrification in thunderstorms, the role of electricity in precipitation formation, and kinetic nucleation. Along with his research position, Vonegut also held an academic appointment in which he taught classes on atmospheric electricity, atmospheric instrumentation, and atmospheric chemistry. During his time at SUNY Albany, Vonnegut received several awards. In 1976, he was awarded the American Meteorological Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Advancement of Applied Meteoroloy. The following year, he recieved the Weather Modification Association Vincent J. Schaefer Award. Along with these awards, Vonnegut was named a Distinguished Research Professor in 1984 and, upon his formal retirement in 1985, was named Professor Emeritus.</p><p> One of Dr. Vonnegut's most notable projects during his time at SUNY Albany was his collaboration with NASA on the Night/Day Optical Survey of Lightning (NOSL) experiments. Astronauts, equipped with specialized recording instruments, took pictures and video of large thunderstorms over the course of three shuttle missions. Dr. Vonnegut, who proposed the project, utilized the photographs and data in his continuing research on thunderstorms and electrification theory.</p><p> Throughout his career, Dr. Vonnegut pursued research in many fields of interest; mainly thunderclouds, tornadoes, and lightning. He made regular summer expeditions to New Mexico where he worked with colleagues at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro to study these phenomena, and many of the experiments he undertook pertain to these three topics. Furthermore, Dr. Vonnegut accumulated multiple patents for his inventions and research techniques. </p><p> Dr. Vonnegut married Lois Bowler (d. 1972) and had five sons. Interestingly, after becoming a father, he took on a personal campaign to improve the quality of educational science texts and encyclopedias, as well as truth in advertising regarding scientific claims on children's products.</p><p> Dr. Vonnegut continued atmospheric research and publishing until his death from cancer at 82 in 1997.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Dr. Vonnegut's papers chronicle his professional career as an atmospheric scientist at MIT, the GE Research Laboratories, Arthur D. Little Corporation, and the State University of New York at Albany's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center and Department of Atmospheric Sciences. The collection spans from 1828 his death in 1997. The earliest materials in the collection are reprints of articles that he referenced for his research.</p><p> The records in this collection document Dr. Vonnegut's research interests. These interests include icing and atmospheric electricity, cloud physics, thunderstorms, and tornado formation. The collection also contain extensive information about his major scientific discoveries and experiments, such as Project Cirrus, a program that sought ways to artificially influence precipitation, the NASA/NOSL project where he studied weather phenomena from space, and his experiments and research in New Mexico. Additionally, a small amount of personal records are interspersed in the collection.</p><p> The collection is arranged into 11 series. The records consist of technical memoranda, research, data, inventions and patent forms, equipment specifications, drawings, figures, handwritten notes, manuscripts, reports, correspondence, publicity materials, course materials, news clippings, photographs, memorabilia, and audio/video materials. The majority of materials date from Dr. Vonnegut's tenure at GE, Arthur D. Little, and State University of New York at Albany.</p><p> All series are arranged alphabetically and reflect Dr. Vonnegut's own filing system. Since the original order was maintained, correspondence is kept with other materials, such as reports and technical memorandum, when they were found together. If the correspondence was found in a seperate place than the materials it was originally meant to be paired with, there was not an effort to reunite the materials. Copies of reports and memorandum may be found in multiple locations.</p><p> For related materials, please see the following collections held by the ME Grenander Department of Special Collection and Archives: Atmospheric Sciences Research Center Records (UA-450), which includes many publications and articles issued by the ASRC, Duncan Blanchard Papers (UA-902.065), Raymond Falconer Papers (UA-902.014) and Vincent J. Schaefer (UA-902.010).</p>  </scopecontent>

Contents</head><p>Series 2 documents the NOSL (Nighttime/Daylight Optical Survey of Thunderstorm Lightning) experiment, a large-scale project undertaken by NASA during the early 1980s, in which astronauts recorded and documented thunderstorm and lightning activity from the Earth's orbit. Dr. Vonnegut, who proposed the project, utilized the photographs and data in his continuing research on thunderstorms and electrification theory.</p><p> The series contains data, reports, correspondence, press releases, photographs, and NASA technical memoranda and shuttle specifications regarding the NOSL project. Crew activity plans and specifications are filed by flight number. Associated documents were kept with their respective flight number as much as possible. Additionally, memorabilia from one shuttle flight is incorporated, including a signed photograph from the astronauts who took part in the experiment.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_fd95274fda41a03f8aff695d626e73fb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Curtner, M.L.

Little, Dr. Vonnegut built upon his research in atmospheric science. The majority of his work focused on electrification of clouds, thunderstorms, and the behavior of lightning, he also looked at behaviors of gases but on a much smaller scale. Besides pursuing his own research, Dr. Vonnegut worked on a number of advisory projects for the United States government. These projects focused on the relationship between aircrafts and lightning. The main focus was on how aircrafts detect and avoid lightning when flying in a storm.</p><p> The series contains data, reports, correspondence, press releases, photographs, newspaper clippings, drawings, figures, and handwritten notes. The arrangement reflects Dr. Vonnegut's original filing system. Materials are first filed by item type and then by subject. In cases where different types of materials were filed together, Dr. Vonnegut's arrangement was maintained to reflect how he used and viewed the materials. This is most prevalent in correspondence files. Correspondence is sometimes paired with clippings or reports. If the correspondence was separated from the items it was originally paired with, the archivist maintained this arrangement.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_799677c282573203627a11923a0dd3a9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Panel for Weather Modification - NSF</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1953/1964" type="inclusive">1953-1964</unitdate><container id="aspace_362bd74a10d4e2a6b95edf2ffc4c5d36" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (3-Arthur D.

While both were employed at Arthur D. Little, he and fellow scientist Charles Moore were invited to conduct thunderstorm research at Mt. Withington, eventually becoming part of the Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research in Socorro. Moore stayed at NMIMT, and Dr. Vonnegut moved on to the State University of New York at Albany; though their collaborative research continued for the entirety of each other's career.</p><p> The series includes a large amount of correspondence with Charles Moore, as well as with other prominent figures related to NMIMT; Marx Brook, Stirling Colgate, and William Winn. This series also consists of data, research, and articles regarding experiments in New Mexico.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_e54a29a6827d96238efb0f3e4e85cc52" level="file"><did><unittitle>215 Experiment</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1953/1987" type="inclusive">1953-1987</unitdate><container id="aspace_9ce55df3392da84b87bb81663571101f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-New Mexico)</container><container id="aspace_2cd353368e44c2f1ed7dfafc580452d8" parent="aspace_9ce55df3392da84b87bb81663571101f" type="Folder">1-2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6c2dc56efbc14eceac0f8d504930eef2" level="file"><did><unittitle>215 Experiments</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1828/1997" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e10d381f49105a7884c15fff20f79ec6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Oversized">3</container><container id="aspace_57d1bf8274e4ca8404387f7e98b1db47" parent="aspace_e10d381f49105a7884c15fff20f79ec6" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_dc76ca98c7776a26e3e1a45804853c33" level="file"><did><unittitle>215 Experiments</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1828/1997" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_2e86c1243a0e9008ca51954ac89db52e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Flat-File">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_90f455f894863dfa89f252766290552a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brook, Marx</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1960/1992" type="inclusive">1960-1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_1ac47bd262a3ddbd6b661e0287b47414" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-New Mexico)</container><container id="aspace_93797d7c42f6362a026e834a7e9b7cfe" parent="aspace_1ac47bd262a3ddbd6b661e0287b47414" type="Folder">3-4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_3b708f531adc9a110acd7bdc056f35f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chew, Joe "Storms above the Desert"</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1985/1986" type="inclusive">1985-1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_1d394923ced28d74021f68ee11243755" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-New Mexico)</container><container id="aspace_264fe2e9aed370240a45244b52373581" parent="aspace_1d394923ced28d74021f68ee11243755" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ac2318781c68bc4446370d06647b9465" level="file"><did><unittitle>Colgate, Dr. Stirling A.</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1965/1985" type="inclusive">1965-1985</unitdate><container id="aspace_9eb2bd0a5538a2f1719d72405ede2484" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-New Mexico)</container><container id="aspace_fed195a75bd04c6d2b7b22dcd5e42773" parent="aspace_9eb2bd0a5538a2f1719d72405ede2484" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_66547bc87b2204dcb79efda62e25d773" level="file"><did><unittitle>Data</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_06b16d01d76fc656f86341811abcd22f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Map-Tube">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_1f73c9505a26ac49cbf86c38e0364873" level="file"><did><unittitle>Data</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1828/1997" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e5cbfa92cb0827e1e8e6c90e519b8ccb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-New Mexico)</container><container id="aspace_645e8b5154d7b4c9ce8fcc67d40478e3" parent="aspace_e5cbfa92cb0827e1e8e6c90e519b8ccb" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_23e156d6594e56b89e72dc1a8b259512" level="file"><did><unittitle>DForest Service/ USDA</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1965/1965" type="inclusive">1965</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1828/1997" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_29450f41419cc1947a224c4bb1597229" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-New Mexico)</container><container id="aspace_593db2019a5f268f5c58a7d1be9b75b8" parent="aspace_29450f41419cc1947a224c4bb1597229" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b73ca91db216b81a543f68e5e65a6a92" level="file"><did><unittitle>Moore, Charles B.

Contents</head><p>Series 8 documents the work that Dr. Vonnegut did while employed at SUNY Albany. During his time at SUNY Albany, Dr. Vonnegut taught classes, served on committees, attended conferences, and continued his research concerning weather, lightning, and clouds. Much of the research that Dr. Vonnegut did while at SUNY Albany was done as part of government research projects. Most notable was his work on Project Themis which was conducted by the United States Air Force. The project's main focus was on the modification and structure of clouds and fog but also investigated other areas of research such as raindrop dynamics and atmospheric electrical phenomena </p><p> Included in this series are flyers, pamphlets, photographs, reports, project proposals, correspondence, travel arrangements, purchasing requests, conference programs, meeting agendas, press releases, newspaper and magazine clippings, handwritten notes, drawings, figures, and materials related to classes Dr. Vonnegut taught. Class materials include lists of students as well as tests and grades students received. Materials with personal information about students are restricted.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_40d2fb22a3b5880e2e8c5822a05ae347" level="file"><did><unittitle>AFCRL Contracts</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1966/1974" type="inclusive">1966-1974</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1828/1997" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_92f5bb0c1e577c0dae025aac0df3faae" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (8-State University of New York at Albany)</container><container id="aspace_5f996405e9c2b41ae7240beefaacf651" parent="aspace_92f5bb0c1e577c0dae025aac0df3faae" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d9361259004957cbd6d093de75dc938b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Air Force Proposal -
