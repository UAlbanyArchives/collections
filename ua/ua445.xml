    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Center for Latino, Latin American, and Caribbean Studies (CELAC) at the University at Albany, SUNY was active from 1984-2018. Its mission was to promote research, publications, technical assistance, and resource services to the academic, international, and local communities focused on the Latin American, Caribbean, and U.S. Latino populations. CELAC relied on the collective expertise of scholars and specialists from a wide range of fields, and fostered interdisciplinary and transnational research approaches, and international collaborations among faculty and academic, governmental, and non-governmental institutions. The Center ceased operations in 2018 and its office space was cleared in early 2019.</p>  </bioghist>
