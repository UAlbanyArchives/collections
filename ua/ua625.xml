    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The first course in computer science, "Introductory to Computer Science," was offered in the fall of 1966 by Edwin Reilly, the head of the Computing Center.[1] Until the fall of 1980 computer science courses were taken as electives or second field of study.[2] During 1979-80 the University Senate approved a major in Computer Science,[3] and a second major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.[5] Both majors were first offered in the <emph render="italic">Undergraduate Bulletin</emph> 1980-81.[5]</p><p> A graduate degree in Computer Science, the Masters of Computer Science, was first announced July 1968.[6] The Ph.D. in Computer Science was approved by the University Senate during 1979-80, and first appeared in the <emph render="italic">Graduate Bulletin</emph>, 1982-84.[7]</p><p> Initially part of the Division of Science and Mathematics of the College of Arts and Sciences, Computer Science became part of the College of Science and Mathematics in 1977 and remained part of that College until 1993. Computer Science became part of the revived College of Arts and Sciences in 1993. In 2005 Computer Science was merged into the newly created College of Computing and Information.</p><p>  <chronlist> <chronitem> <date>1966-1973</date> <event>Edwin D.
