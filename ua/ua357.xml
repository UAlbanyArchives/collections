    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In the first half of the 20th century, payroll activities were administered by the Secretary-Treasurer. As the organization of the University became more complicated, these duties were shifted to a more specialized Payroll Office. Currently, the Payroll Office operates within the Office of Human Resources Management, which is part of the Division of Finance and Administration.</p>  </bioghist>
