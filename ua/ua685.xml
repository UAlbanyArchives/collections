    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Center for Women in Government &amp; Civic Society (CWG) was established in 1978 to elimination of sex discrimination in New York State government employment. This mission is addressed through research to identify and develop methods to remove structural barriers to advancement; training of women and their organizations on leadership, management, and career planning; networking. [CWG Bylaws, 1983, p.1] The Center functioned as part of the Comparative Studies Center, subsequently the Institute for Government and Policy Studies (1981-86) of the Graduate School of Public Affairs, Rockefeller College, State University of New York at Albany. In 1987 the Center became an independent unit of the Graduate School of Public Affairs. The Center receives both public and private funding with its financial management performed by SUNYA and the Research Foundation. [CWG Bylaws, 1983, p.1]</p><p> The Center was co-founded by Nancy Perlman, who served as director until 1986, and Linda Tarr-Whelan, administrative director of the New York State Department of Labor Tarr-Whelan served as President of the Center's Board of Directors until the fall of 1979.</p><p> The CWG was initially governed by the Executive - Ad Hoc Advisory Committee whose members served on and chose the remaining members of the permanent Board of Directors. [CWG Draft Interim Bylaws, p.1] The CWG is governed by a 25 member Board of Directors made up of individuals or representatives of organizations interested and involved in the elimination of sex discrimination in the public sector. The Board meets four times annually or at the request of one-half of the Board or two-thirds of the Executive Committee. The Board is responsible for setting overall Center policy, financial planning, and staffing. The Executive Committee is comprised of the Board President, Secretary and five Board members. It too meets four times a year or at the request of one-half the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee has the power to make decisions of the Board when necessary subject to ratification by the Board. Nominations of new members to the Board of Directors are made by the Executive Committee. [CWG Bylaws, 1983] The day to day operations of the CWG are controlled by the Executive Director, formerly the Director, of the CWG.</p><p> The CWG extended its work to include programs within New York City in 1980 and offers technical assistance to groups and organizations within the state. The Center also contracts outside the State of New York to conduct studies on barriers to the advancement of women. [The Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy Bulletin, p. 45]</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the Center for Women in Government include agendas and minutes, quarterly reports, publications, correspondence, memoranda, and project proposals relating to the mission of the CWG to "identify and remove the barriers to equal employment opportunities for women." These records date from 1976 just prior to the Center's establishment through 1988.</p><p> The records of the CWG are divided into five series: Board of Directors (Governance), 1977-1983; Board President Records, 1976-79; Correspondence, Dec. 1977, 1978-86; Executive Director's Subject Files, 1976-87; and Publications, 1979-88. The Board of Director series was divided into four subseries: Board Members, 1977-83; Board of Directors Meeting Reports, 1977-83; Executive Committee, 1978-81; and Board Correspondence, 1978-86. These records were created and maintained by the Administrative Office of the CWG for Center and Board operations. The Board President Records are the records retained by the CWG of the first Board President and co-founder Linda Tarr-Whelan. They contain material predating the Center's establishment. The Correspondence series contain the day files of the CWG arranged chronologically by year, month and day. These day files were kept because there are no correspondence files New Director of the Center for Women in Government for the period 1977-1986. The records of the Director were interfiled with general correspondence of the Center. The general correspondence (day files) are the primary source of administrative information for that period. The Publications series includes all publications of the CWG printed by contract and in-house.</p>  </scopecontent>
