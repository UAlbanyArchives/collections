    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains copies of the anthropological research magazine Man in the Northeast, covering most issues of the magazine released between 1982 and 1991.  While the magazine released a number of volumes before this time, Man in the Northeast appears to have begun publishing under the auspices of the various Institutes within Albany's Department of Anthropology in the Spring of 1983.  It is during this period when Man in the Northeast was published in Albany that this collection focuses upon.  Currently no copies before Issue #24 or after Issue #42 are held.</p>  </scopecontent>
