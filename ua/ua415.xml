    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Office of Summer Sessions had its origin in 1917, when the first Summer courses were offered at the New York State College of Teachers. When the College grew into the State University of New York at Albany, the responsibility for managing summer sessions came under the supervision of the Dean of Graduate Studies. It later became a distinct entity overseen by the Office of Academic Affairs. The Office was responsible for overseeing enrollment, scheduling, and faculty appointments for courses offered during the Summer Session. As of 2017, these functions are fulfilled by the Office of General Studies and Summer Sessions.</p>  </bioghist>
