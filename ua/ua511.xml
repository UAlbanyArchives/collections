    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions grew out of the Faculty Committee on Admissions, which was originally chaired by the Dean of the College and, after 1948, by the Coordinator of Field Services. By the 1970s, graduate and undergraduate admissions were handled by separate offices: The Office of Graduate Studies and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. As of 2017, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is one of several offices overseen by the Associate Vice President for Enrollment Management, who operates within the Office of the Provost (Academic Affairs).</p>  </bioghist>
