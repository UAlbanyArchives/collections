    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The University at Albany has published various materials related to school, student, and faculty functions for much of its history. At times the University has directly published these materials, but more often than not these items were created by students and faculty of the institution. These materials includeed academic journals and newsletters from individual departments such as the anthropology and criminal justice dpeartments.  Many of these publications did not have long runs and only encompass a few issues. The university continues to support publications from faculty and students and this collection will continue to grow in volume.</p>  </bioghist>
