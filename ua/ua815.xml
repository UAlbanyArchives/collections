    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>During the 1960s the SUNY system was expanded and the existing State College for Teachers became the State University of New York at Albany and one of the four SUNY research centers. A new campus was build on the side of the former Albany Country Club, designed by notable architect Edward Durell Stone. Kenneth Blaisdell, Director of the Campus Center who also ran the university's film and graphic design was the advisor to the film.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>One reel of film, 16mm single perf with audio track. The reel had significant rust which affected the film and damanged the audio track. The film depicts a history of the university from the 1960s to the 1970s and includes aerial and other images of the Uptown Campus, athletics, student life, an Asian-American student group, William Kuntsler speaking, and President Louis T. Benezet.</p>  </scopecontent>
