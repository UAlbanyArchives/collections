    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The University at Albany has a long history dating back to 1844 when it was established as the New York State Normal School to train teachers.   The University Archives eventually began collecting news clippings that while not created by the university could potentially be of interest to future researchers interested in the University at Albany.</p>  </bioghist>
