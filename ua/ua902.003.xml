<p>Vivian C. Hopkins was a long-time English professor at the State University of New York at Albany and its predecessors. Born in Troy in 1909, Hopkins received her B.A from Wellesley College and later her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1943. She joined the faculty of the New York State Teachers College in 1941 and taught at the College and later University until her retirement in 1973. Hopkins received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1956 for her study of Francis Bacon's  influence on American thought in the early 19th century. In addition to Bacon, Hopkins published on other literary figures including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Delia Bacon, Dewitt Clinton and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Hopkins died in 1989.</p>  </bioghist>
