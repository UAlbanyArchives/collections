    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
Vivian Constance Hopkins was born in Troy in 1909. She received a high school degree from Lansingburgh High School, a B.A. in English from Wellesley College, an M.A. in playwriting from the University of Michigan, an M.A. in English from Radcliffe College, and finally her Ph.D. in English from the University of Michigan in 1943. During her time at the University of Michigan, Hopkins would become friends, and potentially, a romantic partner, with Virginia Adeline French, with letters in the collection from 1941 to 1945 (of those with dates). In 1941, Hopkins joined the faculty of the New York State College for Teachers (today known as the University at Albany) as an English professor. During her time at the New York State College for Teachers, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1956 for her study of Francis Bacon and his influence on American thought in the early 19th century. In addition to her work on Francis Bacon, Hopkins published on other literary figures including Nathanial Hawthorne, Delia Bacon, Margaret Fuller, Robert Frost, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. She also conducted research on the sixth governor of New York State, DeWitt Clinton. 

During her time at the College, Dr. Hopkins became the mentor and later, friend, of her student Naoshi Koriyama, who studied English Literature and graduated in 1954. Koriyama became a poet and professor in Japan. Dr. Hopkins would continue in her role as a Professor of English when the College became the State University of New York at Albany in 1962, retiring in 1973. She died in 1989. Prior to her death, Dr. Hopkins assisted with the liquidation of the Albany Gravel Company, which was created by her father, John B. Hopkins. During her retirement, she worked to establish The Vivian C. Hopkins Scholarship Award at the University at Albany, SUNY for outstanding scholastic ability and character in the Department of English.

Hopkins is often addressed as "Vivian," "Beech," "Bizzy," and "Constance." The correspondence includes letters and poems from Virginia A. (Adeline) French. These letters, sometimes signed letters as "G.A." or "Ginny Addy," are strongly suggestive a romantic relationship between the women from 1942 to 1945 (of those that have dates on them). While Hopkins occasionally kept a duplicate of her correspondence with individuals and publishers, she did not create any duplicates of her letters to Virginia French. It is unknown what happened to French and the true scope and length of the relationship between two women. Additionally, there are the letters, newsclippings and photographs between Hopkins and her former student, the Japanese poet and professor Naoshi Koriyama. These materials range from 1954 to 1979 and are a mix of correspondence relating to literature and English and Japanese academia to details and updates of Koriyama's life. Hopkins also was a friend of the American Poet, Robert Frost, and the series includes Christmas poetry booklets with personal notes to Hopkins. Finally, this series also includes the diary of her grandfather during his time in the Civil War.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_fd711ef032215bb1877a7ad159860866" level="file"><did><unittitle>"824 Second Avenue [Property Management]"</unittitle><unitdate normal="1941/1967" type="inclusive">1941-1967</unitdate><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_c735f70fa674c86c95aa9ccd97f926da" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_1a68736ba2fc186ebd930d28ecb0621b" parent="aspace_c735f70fa674c86c95aa9ccd97f926da" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_89d0a89a5dfacdaac22e3b848b426847" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Abbie Potts M.S."</unittitle><unitdate normal="1958/1966" type="inclusive">1958-1966</unitdate><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_381152d9c4aafc64fdf2a5f4f10e005d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_5affa382650dd90da8a247860cac8b54" parent="aspace_381152d9c4aafc64fdf2a5f4f10e005d" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_328f51c825c6e2595035239b4e618d12" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Academic Records Official"</unittitle><unitdate normal="1930/1931" type="inclusive">1930-1931</unitdate><unitdate normal="1938/1941" type="inclusive">1938-1941</unitdate><unitdate normal="1948/1948">1948</unitdate><container id="aspace_2f5340b84d9c84efb79e6b5cd261164e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_b0f5375814716c1ed6232e59e4e991d5" parent="aspace_2f5340b84d9c84efb79e6b5cd261164e" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_1d04d815a0092848b71906e366db2d78" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ambrose Bierce Event Flyer</unittitle><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_9d675b89c93e74c788fb3a1848f253a2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_d752f3cba657908f927eae18486334b8" parent="aspace_9d675b89c93e74c788fb3a1848f253a2" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2441b5370ac210214a3d6209c5827f95" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Literature Contract Numbers 1 and 2 Assignment</unittitle><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_a296e2570863edd551b1d4cdc5b496fe" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_c4bc531a1c9b5e08ffc1d0f17052031a" parent="aspace_a296e2570863edd551b1d4cdc5b496fe" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_eab806e78370dabd8f1e377c4067422f" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Am[erican] Studies 1967 Hamilton College"</unittitle><unitdate normal="1967/1967">1967</unitdate><unitdate normal="1969/1969">1969</unitdate><container id="aspace_72afd2b73f2e4aa97e47ef8594b57549" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_05c1bb5951f6e623048ab81277f242be" parent="aspace_72afd2b73f2e4aa97e47ef8594b57549" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_64e1e04c6a3d0297036eccbbe7bb8e02" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aunt May's Geneaology Book</unittitle><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_869300d977cc4e08dbb980b76fd7dc21" label="Mixed Materials" type="Oversize">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7a36c7ba1c479c4ccf7736358cea0876" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aunt May's Geneaology Book, Loose Material</unittitle><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_32a087b962d2404cf9b512c9e1a0577a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_e1d5e1044fa4ee42eba6d4f8afa7ab0f" parent="aspace_32a087b962d2404cf9b512c9e1a0577a" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b31e714db308464e1b8402011ca67c23" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Aunt May's [Geneaology] Records"</unittitle><unitdate normal="1978/1978">1978</unitdate><unitdate normal="1861/1984" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_6ee437b31dc04031084f9afba550b298" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_ab9b204de7885dd06211db5b9f1525b3" parent="aspace_6ee437b31dc04031084f9afba550b298" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_312f3e8cce1165db65e61a92062be018" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bennet Junior College Presidency Candidate Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate normal="1956/1956">1956</unitdate><container id="aspace_e8508a6371236490d7d3ead7b0985d3a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_0d95eb264239adb20c38d90599b57d11" parent="aspace_e8508a6371236490d7d3ead7b0985d3a" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a82c470d859ba448069dfc9f438e4bf5" level="file"><did><unittitle>"B.F.H.

However, it also includes newspaper clippings about her publications, secondary sources that were used in her research process, typescripts, author's galleys, drafts and publication copies of serial articles, fictional short stories and plays, and monographs. Included in this are folders of unidentified research notes and fictional works. Furthermore, it contains correspondence concerning research questions, and correspondence for manuscript proposals, regardless of success or failure to publish them.  </p><p>The series focuses on several literary and historical figures, family members, and topics of particular interest to Hopkins. These include DeWitt Clinton, Delia Bacon, Francis Bacon, Herman Melville, Francis Adrian Van Der Kemp, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the portrayal of Satan in English literature.

Vivian's father, John B. Hopkins, and brother, Richard W. Hopkins, both served as presidents of the company, with the latter becoming president after his father's death. Following the sudden death of John in 1972, Vivian, who was a member of the Board of Directors, started the liquidation of the company to Valente Gravel.
