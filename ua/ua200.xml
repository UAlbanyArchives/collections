    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The earliest predecessor of the University at Albany Senate (commonly referred to as the University Senate) was the Faculty Council, whose minutes date from 1915 through 1937. The Faculty Council, whose members consisted of the President, Deans, and faculty representatives, functioned as an advisory body on campus policy and academic affairs.[1] No records of the Faculty Council exist after May 1937.</p><p> In June 1944, at the urging of the New York State College for Teachers' chapter of the American Association of University Professors,[2] a Faculty-Administration Council was formed to facilitate cooperation between faculty and administration on any policy that "touches faculty-administration relationships and the general welfare of the college."[3] Its membership consisted of the President of the College, the Dean, other members of the administrative staff, and twelve elected faculty members. Six new faculty members, two from each academic rank, were elected in May of each year to serve two-year terms. Faculty membership in the Council would rise to eighteen by 1962, still equally divided by rank.[4] The faculty members of the Faculty-Administration Council held separate meetings as a Faculty Council "to consider common problems and policies, assign committee responsibilities in certain areas, and formulate recommendations to be submitted to the Faculty-Administration Council."[5] The last mention of a Faculty-Administration Council meeting appears in 1955.[6]</p><p> The Faculty Council's mission was to represent "the faculty as a whole . . . . act as a liaison and advisory body to the Administration . . . representing faculty opinion on matters of College policy and in the broader aspects of College planning" and "develop and sustain the best possible conditions of faculty life, work, and morale."[7] After 1955, liaison between the Faculty Council and the administration was achieved through a bi-monthly conference of the chairman of the Faculty Council and the President, at which meeting the President would raise questions he wanted the Faculty Council to discuss. On occasion, the President met with the full Council.[8] The Faculty Council continued to function until it was replaced by the Faculty Senate in 1966.</p><p> As the Faculty Council was transformed into a strictly faculty body, other councils were created to deal with increasingly complex problems of college governance. The first of these bodies was the Academic Council (1953-63), briefly called the College Advisory Council (1952-53), also referred to in the 1962 Faculty Handbook as the Administrative (Academic) Council.[9] It consisted of departmental chairmen and administrative representatives. Its responsibilities included acting on recommendations for undergraduate and graduate course changes and taking "broad curriculum changes to the faculty for a vote."[10] As graduate education assumed a more important role in the College, a Graduate Academic Council was created in 1963 consisting of the Director of Graduate Studies and eight members of the graduate faculty (four appointed by the President, and four elected by the graduate faculty). The Graduate Academic Council's responsibilities were to appoint "study committees on curriculum, admissions, and educational policy" as well as ad hoc committees as the need arose.[11] Shortly after the Graduate Academic Council was formed, President Collins dissolved the Academic Council and created an Undergraduate Academic Council whose membership and functions paralleled those of the Graduate Academic Council.[12] A Student Personnel Council was created, first mentioned in 1962, consisting of personnel staff and faculty appointed by the President. Its mission was to deal with questions involving student activities, counseling, loans and scholarships.[13] The proliferation of councils of the university, coupled with the rapid expansion of the school as it adapted to its new mission as a University Center, made reorganization of this structure imperative by the mid-sixties.[14]</p><p> In the spring of 1966, the University Faculty created the Faculty Senate out of the formerly independent councils of the University including the Faculty Council, the Undergraduate Academic Council, the Graduate Academic Council, and the Student Personnel Council. The mission of the new Faculty Senate included the delegated authority of the University Faculty, granted by the SUNY Board of Trustees, to "participate in the development of educational programs . . . and be responsible for the conduct of the college's instruction, research, and service programs."[15] In addition to these broad delegated powers, the Faculty Senate was also granted the power to form the agenda for meetings, create councils and committees, administer faculty financial affairs, call for referenda, consult on major University reorganizations and appointments, and issue annual reports to the faculty.[16]</p><p> This reorganization reflected the broader conception of the faculty adopted in the SUNYA Faculty by-laws of March 1966,[17] which as applied to the Faculty Senate included as ex-officio members representatives of the SUNY Central Administration, the major administrative officers of SUNYA, local campus representatives of the SUNY Faculty Senate, as well as at large, college, and school representatives of the voting faculty, and voting faculty appointed by the President.[18]</p><p> The Faculty Senate changed its name to the University Senate in October 1969 when student representation was added to the body. Beginning in the fall of 1970, student representation consisted of 33 Senators, one third elected from the graduate body and two thirds from the undergraduate body.[19] In the 1980s, student representation decreased. By 1990, student representation consisted of 15 Senators, 1 elected from the graduate body and 14 from the undergraduate body.[20] With minor variations in the representation of the different groups, the make-up of the Senate has remained the same for a number of years. The University Senate remains the principal policy-making body of the University.</p><p> Notes 1. Faculty Council, Minutes, 1915. There was no specific statement of function for the Faculty Council.

"Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Faculty Council on the Nature of the University," October 1965, pp. 6-8, in particular voiced the Faculty's frustration at not being involved in major decisions affecting the University. Subsequent attempts to ratify new Faculty By-Laws which codified the proliferation of University councils were rejected by the Faculty Council in December 1965.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the University Senate include agendas and minutes, correspondence, memoranda, reports, bills, resolutions, and legislation relating to the University Senate (November 1969 to present), and its predecessor organizations, the Faculty Senate (May 1966-October 1969) the Faculty Council (1915-37, 1944-66), the Faculty- Administration Council (1945-54/55), the Academic Council (1952-63), the Undergraduate Academic Council (1963-66), and the Graduate Academic Council (1964-66). Some minutes of the Faculty-Administration Council are bound with the minutes of the Faculty Council (1944-47). No records exist for the years 1938 through 1943.</p><p> The records of the University Senate and its predecessor bodies contain discussions of faculty academic and social life, changes in academic programs, regulations of student academic and social life, major university reorganization plans, and the composition of the University Senate and its councils. Specific topics discussed include the addition of administrators and students to the University Senate in the late 1960s, the Senate's official statement on the Vietnam War (1970), the University's policy on protests and demonstrations (1967), the implementation of s/u grading in 1969, the elimination of the general degree requirements for a liberal arts education (the CURE proposal) in 1970 and the reimplementation of degree requirements in the 1980s, the development of multidisciplinary majors such as Judaic Studies and Puerto Rican Studies in 1974 and Chinese Studies and Asian Studies in 1979, and the University's smoking policy. Bound with the Faculty Council minutes (1915-37) are the minutes of general Faculty Meetings.</p><p> The records of the University Senate are divided into subgroups, and these subgroups represent either the records of predecessor organizations, the general records of the University Senate or the records of the individual councils of the Senate. The records of councils' committees are found following that council's general records.</p><p> A keyword index is included to facilitate subject access to the general body of this finding aid. Also included in this finding aid is a list of legislation from 1966 to 1980, arranged by academic year and bill number. Following that appendix is a subject index to legislation from 1980 to 1988, prepared by Madelyn Cicero, secretary to the University Senate. The University Archives has not received any Senate legislation from the period 1980 through 1988. These two appendixes are not covered by the keyword index.</p>  </scopecontent>

meetings, and includes some committee reports. Originally, the Academic Council was called the College Advisory Council (1952-53). The Academic Council, sometimes called the Administrative (Academic) Council, was an independent council composed of departmental chairs and administrative representatives. It was responsible for acting upon proposed undergraduate course changes and bringing "broad curriculum changes to the faculty for a vote." Committees of the Council included the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, the Undergraduate Admissions Committee, Academic Standing Committee, and the Library Committee (Faculty Handbook, 1962, p. 16).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_1d2ad90d2864054f79fbbd7f2caeb3a5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes and Memoranda</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1952/1953"

Committee Reports, and general correspondence relating to its responsibility for the general operations of the senate. The Executive Committee is responsible for preparing the agendas for the senate meetings. It also has "urgency powers" to act for the University Senate whenever it is impractical to convene the Senate to make a decision. However, any actions taken under this provision must be approved retroactively by the Senate. The Executive Committee also may serve in an advisory capacity to the President of the University ( Faculty Handbook , 1984, p. 12).

The Governance Commission was responsible for developing and revising the by-laws of the University Senate as well as dealing with other matters concerning the governance of the University Senate as a whole. The Governance Commission has been variously called the Special Committee to Review Faculty By-Laws, the Ad Hoc Committee on Faculty-Student Governance, the Committee on University Governance, the Governance Committee, the University Governance Commission, and the University Commission on Governance. The Ad Hoc Committee on Faculty-Student Governance was formed in 1969 to review Faculty by-laws and recommend revision, and to fashion ways of involving students more in the development of University Policy, "perhaps through the formation of a University-wide Senate" (Governance Commission, Records, 200/20/01). The records in this series from 1967 and 1968 consist of reports by the Faculty Governance Sub-Committee of the state-wide University Faculty Senate. These reports appear to have been the catalyst that led to the formation of the Governance Commission which is responsible for the relationship between the Senate and the councils, schools, and colleges. The SUNYA Governance Commission records reflect the working out of these questions as well as the admission of administrative personnel and students to the University Senate. This series also contains the records of the Committee on Faculty By-Laws (1962-84, 1988-90). This committee continues to review and revise the University faculty by-laws. Also included are University Faculty Senate by-laws and manuals, meeting reports, general SUNY-wide correspondence, ad-hoc SUNY center committees, and policies of the Board of Trustees.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_63e00e4d41392dc2c60b89065b340a96" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Graduate Academic Council (GAC)</unittitle><unitid>15.3</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1.67 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1961/1997" type="inclusive">1961-1997</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_ca8976920dd0d05c25f73c50022fcec0"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and chronologically thereafter.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_691f2c58dbb34a561c03231db7b38da0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series includes agendas and minutes, annual reports, bills and resolutions, and correspondence of the Graduate Academic Council, created in 1961 as the Graduate Council. The Council has responsibility for implementing graduate academic planning as established by the Council on Educational Policy ( Faculty Handbook , 1984, pp. 21-22). The Graduate Academic Council has been concerned with residence requirements (1971), credit transfer policy, guidelines for independent study and research investigations, the conferral of degrees, and the evaluation, revision, and adoption of academic programs. The Graduate Academic Council predates the formation of the Faculty Senate, having functioned as a general council of the College independent of the Faculty Council ( Faculty Handbook , 1962, p. 20). The Graduate Council was created on May 26, 1961, by the Graduate Faculty and replaced the Committee on Doctoral Studies (established in 1960) and the Committee on Graduate Studies (a subcommittee of the Academic Council); the Council also assumed the responsibilities for graduate study that had been the province of the Academic Council (Report of the Graduate Council, May 7, 1962).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3eec5a2604e19d4773e0472ab1fdd626" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Undergraduate Academic Council (UAC)</unittitle><unitid>15.4</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1950/1999" type="inclusive">1950-1999</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_541dfe4d56a9397187caf878ed086283"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and chronologically thereafter.

In 1988, the title of the Council was changed from Library Council to Council on Libraries, Computing and Information Systems, and its responsibilities were expanded to "review plans for and recommend policies for the development and operation of informational systems and technology as well as for library facilities" ( Faculty Handbook , 1989-90, p. 25).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c90d7c9439c1161e939d6cff38b774a5" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>University Life Council (ULC)</unittitle><unitid>15.9</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="2005/2011" type="inclusive">2005-2011</unitdate></did></c><c id="aspace_b1d3a2b4efb302619fbb802eb33997c2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>University Planning and Policy Council (UPPC)</unittitle><unitid>15.10</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="2004/2011" type="inclusive">2004-2011</unitdate></did></c><c id="aspace_c2114af02f6bd74e9bd2cc30e1671c13" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Council on Academic Assessment (CAA)</unittitle><unitid>15.11</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="2004/2011" type="inclusive">2004-2011</unitdate></did></c><c id="aspace_4c6a2f92fd60076738d568e95f9401cc" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Committee on Ethics in Research and Scholarship (CERS)</unittitle><unitid>15.12</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="2010/2011" type="inclusive">2010-2011</unitdate></did></c><c id="aspace_d552dbc2ce6e5154161d5d758b7341ed" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Council on Educational Policy</unittitle><unitid>15.13</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4.5 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1963/1998" type="inclusive">1963-1998</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_5fbeae3abf8dfbf5823809a8c855e200"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and chronologically thereafter.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_c30c2d5f8723d00b0cf309869a530177"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains agendas, minutes, correspondence, budget proposals, reports to the Senate, reports from sub-committees and other councils and memoranda relating to the council's responsibility for the oversight of campus planning and for the establishment of educational priorities.
