    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>From the founding of the New York State Normal School in 1844, the school maintained records of all students who attended. From 1867 on the books were maintained by the President of the school, starting with Joseph Alden. The President even signed the first page of the book declaring that the school will endeavor to teach its students and give them the resources to succeed as future teachers. Whoever recorded the information in these books, documented a variety of personal information on the students to keep for the schools records.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains a series of books where the Normal School maintained the lists of all the students who registered for classes. Each book records the name of the student, year enrolled, hometown, county, and parent or guardian. Later volumes also include their religion. </p><p>     The core three volumes document first yearâ€™s students and when they started at the school. There is also a single book that documents the enrollment of upperclassmen from 1887 to 1898. This documents similar information to the other books but just when student were returning for their senior or junior terms.</p>  </scopecontent>
