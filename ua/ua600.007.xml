<p>On April 4, 2023, the Turning Point USA's (TPUSA) chapter at the University at Albany (UAlbany) held a "Free Speech" event with guest speaker Ian Haworth. This event was protested by various members of the UAlbany community alleging that the event created an unwelcome space for the LBTQA+ community on campus. The protest included members of the UAlbany Chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) which is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America. </p><p>The "Free Speech" Event hosted about fifteen participating students while over one hundred students attended in protest. The University Police Department eventually moved the event from the transfer lounge, when the protesters prevented the event from proceeding, to the third floor where there was more controlled access. Two student protesters were arrested for their participation, one for disorderly conduct and the other for second degree governmental obstruction. The protest began to disperse after three hours. </p><p>On April 14, 2023, the Created Equal and New York State Right to Life groups gathered on the UAlbany campus for a Pro-Life event. The event included a television display of abortion-related imagery and group members approaching passerby students with pamphlets and questions. The event began at 9 AM and by 1 PM, one hundred students had gathered to protest the event. </p><p>Adjunct sociology professor Renee Overdyke was arrested just before 2 PM after attempting to unplug the television screen and was charged with resisting arrest, distrurbing lawful assembly and second degree obstruction of government administration. These charges were later dropped. The event members ended their demonstration just before 3pm and the protesters dispersed soon after.</p><p>After these two events, the AWSS 490Z Research Seminar class in the Department of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies taught by Dr. Rajani Bhatia conducted interviews for a oral history essay assignment. The purpose of the research was to create a public record from participants and/or witnesses of the protests.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Although the terms 'counter protest' and 'protest' are used interchangeably in these materials, they will be preserved as 'protests' as the events that they were responding to were technically not protests, but demonstrations. 'Counter protest' would be more appropriate if they were reacting to an already occuring, or planned protest, instead of events happpening on campus. </p><p>The term 'counter protest' within the materials will not be replaced so as to not change the content, but will be replaced in the description. Arrangment materials referring to 'protests'and 'protesters' are synonymous with the collection's reference to 'counter protests.'</p>  </processinfo>
