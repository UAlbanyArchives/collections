<p>Most Items in this collection prior to 2012 were transferred to the University Libraries, M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives by Mark Schmidt and Paul Miller of the Digital Media Department which is part of the Office of Communication and Marketing.</p><p> Most of the pre-2012 images were written to optical media (DVDs and some CD-Rs) by the University Photographer. Most of the images were raw camera files .NEF and .CR2 with altered derivatives created as JPG and a few TIFF files. Prior to accessioning, the archivist converted all raw camera images to JPG format and accepted only the original derivatives and the converted versions of files without derivatives.</p><p> Most of the images created after 2012 were downloaded <date normal="2015-07-19">2015 July 19</date></p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of both still photographs created digitally by the campus photographer and physical photographic prints, contact sheets and negatives.

    <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
<p>Material from the UAlbanyPhotos website was maintained in its original arrangement. If items were moved the new arrangement was also maintained, so there is the potential for duplication.</p><p> Material that was transferred on optical media were matched by job number found in the top level directory. This job number was matched to a database maintained by the University Photographer which included basic descriptions, the ordering department, and timestamps. For Images from 2010-2012, a newer database was used that did not include descriptions. Descriptions for these items came from the directory names that held the images.</p><p> The images transferred on optical media were matched by the archivist to the arrangement provided by the UAlbanyPhotos website.
 
 Physical photographic materials have also been added to this collection as their own series.</p>  </arrangement>
