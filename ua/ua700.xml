    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The position of Vice President for University Affairs was created in 1972 to oversee various aspects of University administration, including alumni affairs, public relations, and development. The position was phased out in 1989-1990, and many of the offices it oversaw were shifted to the Vice President for University Advancement.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection documents the activities of the Vice President of University Affairs, primarily during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.  Most of the files appear to have come from Sorrell Chesin during his time as the Vice President of University Affairs during that period.   As the Vice President was responsible for development and fundraising during this period, there are a number of files including correspondence, memoranda, form letters and mailing lists maintained by the office for various fundraising activities, especially for the University at Albany Fund.  This collection also documents contract negotiations with on-campus union groups including UUP and CSEA.  The collection also includes memoranda; correspondence; brochures; form letters; alumni and parent relations files; commencement planning files and various reports on the University's fundraising goals.</p>  </scopecontent>
