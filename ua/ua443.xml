    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The University at Albany established the Center for Humanistic Education in 1969.  Borne out of educational reform proposals in the 1960s, the Center was formed with the idea of helping to create an education system that was more “human-centered” and focused on teaching students in a way that would truly resonate with them.  From its founding under the direction of Dr. Alfred Alschuler, the Center was loosely affiliated with the university and received much of its financing from state grants and registration payments for its workshops and presentations.
The Center worked primarily with two-year colleges and high schools around New York State.  One of the Humanistic Education Center’s primary functions was to organize workshops at the University-owned Jesuit Retreat House in Glenmont, New York. Before its move to the Jesuit Retreat House in 1970, the Center had been based out of Richardson Hall on SUNY Albany’s downtown campus.  
As the Center was only loosely affiliated with the University, it was dependent on grants from New York State for its funding.  Drastic funding cuts in 1973 forced the Center to give up its lease on the Jesuit Retreat House and returned to the University campus.  From there further staff cuts led to the  dissolution of the program in either late 1973 or 1974.</p>  </bioghist>
