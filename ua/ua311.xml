    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>University Auxiliary Services (UAS) replaced the Faculty-Student Association in 1976. The name change was motivated by a desire to avoid confusion with other groups with the words student association in their names. University Auxiliary Services is a nonprofit organization that provides a variety of services to enhance campus life, including: dining and catering, bookstore, banking, and others. UAS is responsible for securing and managing local and national contracts.</p>  </bioghist>
