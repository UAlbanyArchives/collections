    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>Mildred Cunningham held the position of Downtown Campus Coordinator from 1973-1976. During this time she began many improvements to the campus. During her tenure at the University at Albany there were various changes being made in response to the growth of the school with the construction of the Uptown Campus. Curriculum changes were made and various schools within the University shifted location. One major curriculum change was a shift to create more night classes for part-time and adult students who worked during the day and wanted to attend college at night.
    With the growing campus population changes were made within the buildings downtown to accommodate a more modern classroom. Interiors of the buildings were remodeled, creating larger classrooms to accommodate more students. According to the documents there was also a plan to expand the campus across Western Avenue by purchasing Thurlow Terrace. This plan never came to fruition due to a lack of funds to meet the desires of the community.
    One more major change evident in this collection is the restoration of the Hawley Library murals. This was done in cooperation with the Cooperstown Public History Program. Students learning preservation were housed in the dorms in the summer of 1975 and worked on the murals, restoring them to their original condition.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection holds a variety of materials created by the Downtown Campus Coordinator from 1973-1976. The records document the changes that occurred on the old campus of SUNY Albany as the needs of students changed in the 1970s. There is a great deal of correspondence and meeting minutes surrounding the introduction of more night classes to the curriculum. This is typically between the Coordinator Mildred Cunningham and the heads of various academic departments. There is also correspondence concerning the rehabilitation of the downtown campus through the modification of the interior of buildings to create more suitable classrooms. There are also reports and meeting minutes of the committee that oversaw this project, which Cunningham was a member of. Plans for expansion of the downtown campus across Western Avenue at Thurlow Terrace is evident through a series of communication with SUNY administration.
There is also a significant amount of documents related to the restoration of the Hawley Library murals. This includes a collection of photos documenting the project and the work being done by Cooperstown students, as well as applications for housing on campus during the summer the murals were restored. Lastly there is correspondence and records pertaining to income gathering plans such as renting out space on campus and a chamber music series.</p>  </scopecontent>
