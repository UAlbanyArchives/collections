    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>In 1966 the University at Albany ran its first fund raising campaign for the Community Chest-Red Cross Joint Appeal. The Albany Community Chest was an early iteration of The United Way that was founded in 1925 and servred the Albany area. The goal of the fund raising campaign was to raise funds for local communities in need of aid. This was done through donations, volunteer work, and large fund raising events such as dinners or cocktail hours. Members of the community would attend to discuss the problems they are facing as well as seeking out donations.
     The University end of the work was represented by those in administrative positions and aided by faculty. A yearly committee was created and they would take charge of fund raising tactics, and would be the ones to roganize the event for that year be it a dinner or cocktail hour. 
     The name of the organizaiton was changed The United Fund of Albany in 1969, and the University continued its fundraising activity with the joint groups. The collection documents this activity up until 1974 and also shows more activity in 1986 with a new consolidated version of the United Fund that had merged with the United Way of Saratoga County to form the United Way of Northeastern New York.</p>  </bioghist>
