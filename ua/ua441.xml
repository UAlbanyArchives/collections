    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The University at Albany's Office established the Albany Collegiate Center in 1933 to provide employment for well qualified individuals and to bring collegiate instruction to worthy high school graduates who could not afford to attend a regularly established college. Edward J. Farley was director of the Center, which closed in 1937.</p>  </bioghist>
