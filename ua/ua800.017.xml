The Gender and Sexuality Resource Center (GSRC) is a group based in the campus center. There is a director of the center who is aided by departamental liasons across the Uptown and Downtown Campuses. These people are faculty and staff who are available to assist LGBTQ students with any campus related problems. The GSRC also hosted many events in tandem with LGBTQ student groups including a Second Chance Prom and Safe Space Training sessions.
