    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Center for Undergraduate Education was established in 1978 as a result of the reorganization of the University College and the Office of Undergraduate Studies. It was overseen by the Office of Undergraduate Studies and was tasked with providing advisement services for freshman and all undergraduates who had not yet declared a major.  These functions are now administered by the Advisement Services Center.</p>  </bioghist>
