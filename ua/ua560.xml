    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) began in the summer of 1968 after a demand by the SUNYA Senate faculty and Black Student Alliance. The program represented a commitment to providing higher education opportunities for disadvantaged students with a motivation for college study. All those enrolled in the program were required to be residents of New York state, be educationally disadvantaged, and come from a low-income situation or live in a residence located in an area dominated by families with low incomes. Most students came from urban settings, with 60% from upstate and 40% from New York City. In the first year of operation, 160 students were enrolled. Funding originally came from the State of New York through SEEK appropriation. By September 1969, 370 students were enrolled in the program. Individual budgets were made for each student depending on their financial situation. EOP was focused on providing support services in three areas: academic, counseling, and financial services. Study and tutoring programs were available alongside reduced course loads. Counselors worked with the students as advisors on both personal and academic issues. </p><p>EOP continues to operate at the University at Albany under state and federal funding with a similar mission to provide academic services and support for economically or educationally disadvantaged students.</p>  </bioghist>
