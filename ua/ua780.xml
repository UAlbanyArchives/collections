    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Office of University Advancement was established in 1988 to coordinated development and public relations programs.  Subordinate offices it oversaw included the Alumni Affairs Office, Office of Development, the Community Events Office, and the Office of University Relations.  Additionally, it was affiliated with the University at Albany Foundation, the Alumni Association, and the Benevolent Association. It became the Division of University Development in 2006 and the public relations functions shifted to the newly created Division of Government Affairs and Public Relations (later known as the Division of Communication and Marketing and now known as the Office of Communications and Marketing). The Division of University Development has since been renamed the Division of University Advancement.</p>  </bioghist>
