    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Women's studies at the University began in the fall of 1971 with a course on women in modern literature offered through the College of General Studies.  In the Fall of 1972, the Albany chapter of the Caucus for Women's Rights of the State University of New York formed to develop a women's studies program.  In the Spring of 1973, women's studies became an officially approved minor, and a part-time director of women's studies was appointed. A Women's Studies B.A. was first offered in 1989.  The department is now known as the Department of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and it offers a B.A., an M.A., a certificate in Women and Public Policy, and a joint M.A./Sociology Ph.D.</p>  </bioghist>
