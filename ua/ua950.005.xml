    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The University's main campus, the Uptown Campus, has been described as a distinctive work of modern art. Designed in 1961-1962 by renowned American architect Edward Durell Stone (1902-1978), the campus bears Stone's signature style of bold unified design, evident in buildings from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Construction on the initial set of buildings began in 1962 and finished in 1971. The next building to be built on campus, Freedom Quad, opened in 1988.</p><p> The Uptown Campus is defined by a central Academic Podium complex, main fountain complex with carillon tower, and four quadrangle residence halls that dominate much of the campus.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains planning documents used in the development and construction of the University at Albany, SUNY's Uptown campus. Of particular interest are the regular progress memos providing indepth information about challenges and development with construction.</p><p> The majority of plans included in this collection (such as the 1974 plans, 30,000-40,000 student scenario) were never realized and the buildings were not constructed in the 1970s as anticipated in the previous decade.</p>  </scopecontent>
