    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>On February 15, 1898, Edith Stoneman, Gertrude Hall, and nine other students of the New York State College for Teachers organized the Psi Gamma Sorority. L. Elizabeth Reed became the first president of the sorority and Margaret Mooney of the New York State College English Department became its first sponsor. In 1906 the sorority rented an apartment and soon thereafter moved into a house on Clinton Street where it held its regular meetings for several years ["Psi Gamma Sorority Brochure 1898-1988", p. 6, Anniversary - 90th, Psi Gamma Sorority Subject Files].</p><p> On April 29, 1922, twenty-two faculty, alumnae, and active sorority members founded the Alumnae Association ["Minutes of the Alumnae Association of Psi Gamma Sorority", p. 2, Minutes - Annual Meeting and Executive Meeting, Psi Gamma Alumnae Association Subject Files]. Two years later, on February 2, 1924, 16 members of the Alumnae Association signed a Certificate of Incorporation after the motion was made, seconded, and carried during the association's regular meeting ["Minutes", p. 22]. Later that year the association purchased the Lochner house at 1104 Madison Avenue for the active sorority. Three years later the alumnae association sold the Lochner House and purchased the J. Harris Loucks House at 113 South Lake Avenue, where the sorority was housed until 1959 ["Minutes", p. 57-59].</p><p> In 1963, the University at Albany, under the leadership of President Even R. Collins, required each Greek organization to sell its house and move into the new residence halls on the main campus ["Memo To Faculty and Students", May 22, 1963, Greek Workshops Folder 1, Psi Gamma Sorority Subject Files]. In spite of widespread student discontent over this new policy, Psi Gamma Sorority moved to Van Rensselaer Hall in 1965 ["Minutes, February 15 1965", Minutes-Regular Meeting 1964-1965, Psi Gamma Sorority Subject Files].</p><p> Enrollment in national Greek organizations began to increase in 1976 when the SUNY University Board of Trustees revoked its ban against national fraternities and sororities. In 1991 Psi Gamma held a vote in order to determine whether or not the sorority would also seek a national sponsor. Only one-third of the active members voted to continue Psi Gamma's tradition as a local chapter. The other members separated to form a new chapter of the national Alpha Xi Delta Sorority [<emph render="italic">Alumnae Newsletter</emph>, February 1992, p.2, Alumnae Newsletters 1981-1997, Alumnae Association Subject Files].</p><p> In 1991 a group of students at Stony Brook, SUNY, approached the Psi Gamma Sorority seeking admission as a sister sorority. Psi Gamma recognized the new group as the Psi Gamma Sorority Beta Chapter even though such an event was without precedent. The Alumnae Association believed that only it had the right to recognize branch sororities, though it also recognized that changes in its Constitution and Articles of Incorporation were necessary in order to do so ["<emph render="italic">Alumnae Newsletter</emph>, February 1992", p. 2]. In 1993, the association amended these documents and officially adopted the Psi Gamma Sorority at Stony Brook as the Beta Chapter; a sister sorority to the Alpha Chapter in Albany [<emph render="italic">Alumnae Newsletter</emph>, Spring 1994, p. 1, Alumnae Newsletters 1981-1997, Alumnae Association Subject Files].</p>  </bioghist>

correspondence, minutes, newsletters, constitutions, membership lists, and video cassettes. The annual and executive board meeting minutes, (1922-1956), annual meeting minutes (1956-1995, missing 1971-1973, 1975-1981, and 1985-1986), and the board of directors minutes (1971, 1981-1995, missing 1982, 1984, and 1986) record the quarterly meetings of the executive board and the annual meetings of the association. The alumnae newsletters (1952-1997) are quarterly publications that inform alumnae members of upcoming and past alumnae events. The newsletters also list the activities of alumnae members, Psi Gamma Sorority events, meeting minutes, budget reports, and other issues that might be of interest to alumnae members. The constitution (1924-1993), which was recently amended in 1993, documents the association's mission statement and rules for organization. Finally, the association regularly provides detailed information about members' addresses and phone numbers in the membership lists (1922-1983) and officer lists (1988-1995).</p><p> Of particular note in this series is the Edna Shaffer MacAffer award file (1924-1992) that contains MacAffer's biographical information as well as information about the annual award named in her honor. Also of note is the video recording of the 1994 annual meeting, where Grace Maguire Swanner was honored an a distinguished alumni and each alumnae member briefly introduced herself in front of everyone attending the reunion.</p><p> Alumnae Newsletters include upcoming and recent sorority and alumnae activities, activities of alumnae members, meeting minutes, and president's letters.</p><p>
