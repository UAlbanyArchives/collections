    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The University's Public Relations Office, responsible for press releases and public information, was created circa 1961.  In the late 1960s, it became the Office of Community Relations, which was incorporated into the newly-formed Office of University Affairs in 1972.  The title changed again when it became the Office of University Relations (sometime prior to 1985), although, somewhat confusingly, there was a brief period in the 1990s when the Office of Community Relations was reintroduced and existed alongside the Office of University Relations.  From 1990 through circa 2005, the Office of University Relations was administered by the Division of University Advancement.  As of 2017, public information and media relations are managed by the Office of Communications and Marketing.</p>  </bioghist>
