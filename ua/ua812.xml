<p>WSUA 640AM, the University's first student radio station, was founded in 1963. It featured music, news programs, and live broadcasts of University at Albany sporting events. In 1978, the station received an FM license from the FCC and became WCDB 90.9FM. Since its switch to FM broadcasting, the station has continued to broadcast an eclectic mix of news programs and free-format music both over the air and online.</p>  </bioghist>
