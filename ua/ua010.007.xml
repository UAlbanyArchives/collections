    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The President's Committee to Review Promotion and Continuing Appointment Policies and Procedures Records was formed in May 1973 to create campus-wide policies relating to how faculty members were granted promotions and tenure.  In the wake of UAlbany's expansion in the 1970s tenure had become a contentious topic and creating standards for assigning tenure was deemed prudent.  Following discussion between student and faculty committee members along with correspondence with other universities, the committee's findings were presented to the University President in February of 1974.</p>  </bioghist>
