    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Alumni Association collected information on graduates as well as memorabilia of alumni since its founding in 1849. Unfortunately, the devastating New York State Normal College fire of January 8, 1906 destroyed those early collections as it did the portraits of early school leaders and the Alumni Memorial Window in the Willett Street Building. In consequence there are relatively few items of memorabilia in the collection from the 19th Century, and what is known about the graduates of the New York State Normal School and the New York State Normal College through 1906 is largely found in the<emph render="italic">Historical Sketch of the State Normal School</emph>, 1884 and the <emph render="italic">Historical Sketch of the State Normal College</emph>, 1894. A hand annotated copy of the 1894 history was maintained by the Alumni Association with interleaved pages and contains updates to the names, addresses and careers of graduates of the Normal School/College (1844-1914), and subsequently the New York State College for Teachers (1914-1959) through 1918.</p><p> During the 1910s through the 1950s alumni have been particularly generous with donating their memorabilia, scrapbooks, play programs, photos of events such as Rivalry, Moving Up Day, commencements, plays, fraternities and sororities, and the general round of social life. With the advent of the 1960s there has been a significant diminution of alumni donation of memorabilia, and while many classes during the 1920s-1940s have upwards of a hundred individual items of memorabilia, very few approach that number in later years, often numbering the teens or twenties.</p><p> In 1988 the University Archives took over custodianship of the Alumni Memorabilia Collection from the Alumni Association.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Items in this collection have been transferred to the Alumni Association of the University at Albany, SUNY for the past 100 years. The collection consists of autograph books, broken runs of bulletins, catalogues, and commencement exercises; the correspondence of alumni, faculty and students; newspaper clippings; photographs of alumni, faculty, students, student events and buildings; programs for student and local plays; programs of college and student events, scrap books, song books, student literary publications and yearbooks. The collection documents the day-to-day student life at the University at Albany and its predecessor institutions: the State Normal School, 1844-1890; the New York State Normal College, 1890-1914; the New York State College for Teachers, 1914-1959; the State University of New York College of Education at Albany, 1959-61; the State University of New York College at Albany, 1961-62; and the State University of New York at Albany, 1962-1986.</p><p> Though the span date of the collection is 1844 through 1991, there are few items before 1860. The nineteenth century materials consist primarily of formal portrait photographs of students and faculty; autograph books from 1860, 1861, and 1889 (autograph books were the forerunners of college yearbooks--see the University Archives Autograph Book Collection for more extensive examples of the genre); scattered commencement exercises and diplomas (see the University Archives Diploma Collection and Commencement Series for other examples); the correspondence of Anna E. Pierce, a graduate of the Class of 1884, and future Dean of Women; and the papers of Carolyn Mayhew, a graduate of the Class of 1892, and assistant school principal in New York City (including her essays and an autobiographical book<emph render="italic">Life on A Diary Farm in the Nineteenth Century</emph>).</p><p> The twentieth century holdings of the collection are much richer, consisting, in addition to the usual commencement programs and photographs, of a variety of regalia including athletic letters from 1927; womens basketball memorabilia donated by Lorna Shafer including a list of rules of personal conduct of women athletes; candle holders used on Torch Night and Candlelight Ceremony; dance cards; felt arm bands from the classes of 1913, 1918, 1921, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1935, 1937, 1949; play programs, particularly from the period when Agnes Futterer lead theatrical programming (1918-1956), as well as programs for events held at local and New York City theaters; school pins from fraternities, sororities, and MYSKANIA (the student honorary and guardian of traditions); scrap books from members of the class of 1923, 1926, 1929, 1933, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1949; song books; student literary and humor magazines; tea pots from Syddum Hall; women's gym rompers dating from 1927 and 1937.</p><p> The collection is strongest in the period from 1920 through the mid-1950s and weakest before and after those dates. With notable exceptions, primarily scattered copies of student publications, the Alumni Memorabilia Collection contains few items from the 1960s on.</p><p> The Alumni Memorabilia Collection exists 1) to provide a repository for items which can be exhibited at Alumni Reunions, Homecoming and in the wider University community, and 2) to provide a mechanism by which the University Archives can document student life at the University and its predecessor institutions. To achieve these goals we solicit donations which are attractive, colorful and/or informative, and at the same time we collect materials which will give us insight into student life, both in and outside of classes.</p><p> University Archives plans to add new class memorabilia to this finding aid on an annual basis.</p>  </scopecontent>

In the days leading to commencement, the class held a Senior Banquet at Herbert's, a Senior Ball at the Aurania Club, Class Day Exercises at Page Hall followed that evening by the Class Sing and Torchlight Procession at Draper Hall, and finally, a senior breakfast on the morning of graduation at the Boulevard Cafeteria.</p><p> During the Class of 1949's tenure on campus, New York State College for Teachers President John Sayles resigned in March 1947 because of ill health and was replaced by Acting President Milton Nelson who held the position until July 1949. The College officially became part of the newly created State University of New York on April 1, 1949. In addition, in May 1949, the student body selected the Pedguin, a penguin-like figure designed by Paul Kirsch '51, as the official College mascot.</p><p> There is a significant amount of memorabilia from the Class of 1949 including yearbooks, event programs, materials from Senior Week and commencement exercises, handbooks, directories, and many materials from reunions. Of particular interest may be the scrapbooks from Elfriede Laemmerzahl Miller, Margaret Hoefner Baynes and Lucy Lytle Merrill documenting student life from 1945-1949. Miller's scrapbook includes the program for Frosh Weekend 1945 and Freshman Week as well as her freshman beanie and upperclass red hat. Merril's scrapbook contains a large number of photographs including classmates and campus events. Baynes' three scrapbooks include many tickets and special event programs.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_85d50fc2d8f7f55e623bf85408bf2dad" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lucy Lytle's Elementary and

Collins at the New York State College for Teachers on Sunday morning June 13, 1954 on the Alumni Quadrangle. Dr. Earl McGrath, president of the University of Kansas City, delivered the commencement address. In the days leading to commencement, the senior class participated in a class banquet at Jack's, a semi-formal Senior Ball at the Aurania Club, the Senior Skit and Torch Night.</p><p> This series contains class directories, event programs, files related to Senior Week activities, newspapers, pennants and reunion materials. Of special interest is the Freshman Camp for Women brochure from 1950 and programs from the men's basketball team's games in 1950-1951 and 1954. As 1954 graduate Naoshi Koriyama is a published poet, there also are several of his publications in the collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_da84392b5523d45b3dc5620fe017c37c"

The school name changed from State University of New York College of Education at Albany (September 1, 1959 - October 16, 1961) to the State University of New York College at Albany (October 16, 1961 - August, 1962) to the State University of New York at Albany (August 1962 - Fall 1986). The groundbreaking ceremony for construction on the new Uptown Campus was held in August 1962. In September 1962 the school admitted its first freshmen non-teacher preparatory students as candidates for bachelor of arts degrees in Liberal Arts and Sciences. The 1963 yearbook was the first to be named the<emph render="italic">Torch</emph>. The school newspaper <emph render="italic">State College News</emph> became the <emph render="italic">State University News</emph> in February 1963 and the <emph render="italic">Albany Student Press</emph> in February 1964. In addition, one of the most noticeable changes was the assessment of tuition for the first time in the Fall of 1963. This event and related student protests are chronicled in the yearbooks and Class of 1964 Senior Record.</p><p> Nearly 600 undergraduate students received their bachelor's degrees from President Evan R. Collins at the New York State College for Teachers on Sunday morning June 14, 1964 at Thurlow Terrace. Buell G. Gallagher, president of City College of New York, served as the commencement speaker.</p><p> This series contains class directories, event programs, school mascots, attire, student handbooks and yearbooks. Of special interest are the many files related to the incoming student/freshman experience including Frosh Week programs and bulletins. Class members Robert Fairbanks, Evelyn J. Petrick and Mary Young Osielski contributed the majority of memorabilia.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_4c5561d7a135ea3cf57dddf8a1a31853" level="file"><did><unittitle>Admissions Correspondence for Evelyn J.

id="aspace_f70e9c62d085808fd18b04338da0c356"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>More than 650 men and women received their degrees from President Evan R. Collins at the State University of New York at Albany on Sunday morning June 11, 1967. U.S. Senator Jacob K. Javits delivered the commencement address to a class in transition in many ways. During the Class of 1967's years on campus, enrollment increased dramatically reaching a then all-time high of 7,094 in the Fall of 1966, the Uptown Campus was built and the University rented any available space it could locate to temporarily hold classes during the building process. The Uptown Campus officially opened during the group's final year of studies, students moved into new dorms and the Class of 1967 began using new facilities like the Campus Center. Old policies and traditions, including a curfew for women students and the wearing of the freshman beanie, were being laid to rest. The class helped usher in new student traditions, such as Telethon which became a popular 24 hour fund-raising event to benefit the New York State Mental Health Association, Inc. started in October 1966.</p><p> Henry M. Madej, BA 1967, is the main contributor to this class' collection and an active member of the Albany community. He is a member of the University Alumni Association and the Pine Hills Neighborhood Association. Please see the Henry M. Madej Papers, APAP-140, for more information.</p><p> This series is divided into administrative records and special events.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_dcb28fa4882c139e8979d637d2a06755" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Administrative Records</unittitle><unitid>1967.1</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1963/1968" type="inclusive">1963-1968</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_8b1cd57b6445ce95972281fe0cc4446d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_450ac4bf9efee55352da8e0a0075ed2b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains Central Council minutes, agendas, constitutions, and other student government files.
