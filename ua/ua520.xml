    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Robert Morris started at the State University of New York at Albany in 1966 as Dean of the University College, which had been established in 1963 to oversee academic affairs for freshmen and sophomores.  The University College presided over nearly every aspect of academic life for underclassmen, including academic probation, advisement, attendance, and withdrawal. He was later promoted to Dean of Undergraduate Studies, a position in which he oversaw both lower- and upper-division undergraduate education, from 1970 until approximately 1977.  Between these two positions, he oversaw all aspects of the administration of undergraduate education at the University, with a focus on the drafting, creation and implementation of policies for students in the lower division.</p>  </bioghist>
