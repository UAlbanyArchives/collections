Schaefer Papers represent the professional accomplishments and personal interests of the scientist who discovered cloud seeding. Schaefer spent more than 20 years with General Electric in Schenectady, New York, working his way up from apprentice, to research assistant, to research associate. In those years he was mentored by Irving Langmuir, Nobel Prize winner in chemistry. The work Schaefer did at General Electric laid the foundation for further success as he became director of research for the Munitalp Foundation, began a highly successful summer science program for high school students, acted as an independent consultant, and founded the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York at Albany. This collection contains research data, notes, correspondence, publications, and photographs that showcase Schaefer's long, industrious scientific career as well as highlighting his many hobbies in local history and environmentalism.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Vincent J. Schaefer was born July 4, 1906, the oldest son of Peter Aloysius and Rose Agnes (Holtslag) Schaefer. Schaefer had two brothers, Paul and Carl, and two sisters, Gertrude and Margaret. The Schaefers lived in Schenectady, New York but enjoyed spending summers in the Adirondack Mountains. Schaefer had a lifelong association with the Adirondacks, as well as more general interests in hiking, natural history, and archeology. In his youth he was the founder of a local tribe of the Lone Scouts and with some of his friends wrote and printed a tribe paper called "Archeological Research." Schaefer credited this publication with his introduction to many prominent individuals in the Schenectady area, including Dr. Willis R. Whitney of the General Electric (G.E.) Research Laboratory. </p><p> In 1922 Schaefer found himself in the difficult position of having to leave school to supplement the family income. On the advice of his maternal uncles, Schaefer joined a four-year apprentice machinist course at G. E. During the second year of his apprenticeship, Schaefer was granted a one-month leave to accompany Dr. Arthur C. Parker, New York State Archeologist, on an expedition to central New York. As Schaefer was concluding the apprentice course in 1926 he was assigned to work at the machine shop of the G. E. Research Laboratory, where he worked for a year as a journeyman toolmaker.</p><p> Somewhat discouraged by his work in the machine shop, Schaefer sought to satisfy a desire to work outdoors and to travel by joining, initially through a correspondence course, the Davey Institute of Tree Surgery in Kent, Ohio, in 1927. After a brief period working in Michigan, Schaefer asked to be transferred back to the Schenectady area and for a while worked as an independent landscape gardener. Upon the advice of Robert Palmer, superintendent of the G.E. Research Laboratory, in 1929 Schaefer declined an opportunity to enter into a partnership for a plant nursery and instead rejoined the machine shop at the Research Laboratory, this time as a model maker.</p><p> During the late 1920s and early 1930s Schaefer built up his personal library on natural history, science, and his other areas of interest and read a great deal. He also organized groups with those who shared his many interests--the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club in 1929, the Van Epps-Hartley Chapter of the New York Archaeological Association in 1931, and the Schenectady Wintersport Club (which established snow trains to ski slopes in the Adirondacks) in 1932. In 1933 Schaefer began work on creating the Long Path of New York (a hiking trail beginning near New York City and ending at Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks). During this period Schaefer also created adult education programs on natural history topics which gave him opportunities to speak in the community. Through these many activities Schaefer continued to expand his acquaintances, including John Apperson, an engineer at General Electric and a devout conservationist of the Adirondacks. Apperson introduced Schaefer to Irving Langmuir, a scientist at the G.E. Research Laboratory who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1932 for his work in surface chemistry. Among other things, Langmuir shared Schaefer's love of skiing and the outdoors.</p><p> At the Research Laboratory machine shop, Schaefer built equipment for Langmuir and his research associate, Katharine Blodgett. In 1932 Langmuir asked Schaefer to become his research assistant, which Schaefer accepted. In 1933 he began his research work with Langmuir, Blodgett, Whitney, and others at the Research Lab and throughout the G.E. organization. With his new colleagues as well as by himself, Schaefer published many reports on the areas he studied, which included surface chemistry techniques, electron microscope techniques, polarization, the affinity of ice for various surfaces, protein and other monolayers, studies of protein films, television tube brightness, and submicroscopic particulates. After his promotion to research associate in 1938, Schaefer continued to work closely with Langmuir on the many projects Langmuir obtained through his involvement on national advisory committees, particularly related to military matters in the years immediately before and during the Second World War. This work included research on gas mask filtration of smokes, submarine detection with binaural sound, and the formation of artificial fogs using smoke generators-- a project which reached fruition at Vrooman's Nose in the Schoharie Valley with a demonstration for military observers.</p><p> During Schaefer's years as Langmuir's assistant, Langmuir encouraged him to carry on his own research projects. In 1940 Schaefer became known in his own right for the development of a method to make replicas of individual snowflakes using a thin plastic coating called Formvar. This discovery brought him national publicity in popular magazines and an abundance of correspondence from individuals, including many students, seeking to replicate his procedure.</p><p> In 1943 the focus of Schaefer's and Langmuir's research shifted to precipitation static, aircraft icing, ice nuclei, and cloud physics. Many of their experiments were carried out at Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire, where conditions were ideal for ice studies. In the summer of 1946, Schaefer developed a laboratory method to seed supercooled clouds with dry ice, and in November 1946 he conducted a successful field test seeding a natural cloud by airplane. The resulting publicity again brought him an abundance of correspondence, this time from people and businesses making requests for snow as well as scientists around the world also working on weather modification. Schaefer's discovery also led to debates over the appropriateness of tampering with nature through cloud seeding. In addition, the successful field test enabled Langmuir to obtain federal funding to support additional research in cloud seeding and weather modification by the G.E. Research Laboratory. Schaefer was coordinator of the laboratory portion of the U.S. military-sponsored Project Cirrus while the Air Force, Army Signal Corps, and Navy supplied the aircraft and pilots to carry out field tests and to collect the data used at the Research Laboratory. Field tests were conducted in the Schenectady area as well as in Puerto Rico and New Mexico.</p><p> When the military pilots working on Project Cirrus were assigned to duties in connection with the Korean War, G.E. recommended that Project Cirrus be discontinued after comprehensive reports were prepared of the project and the discoveries made. The final Project Cirrus report was issued in March 1953. While Project Cirrus was winding down, Schaefer was approached by Vernon Crudge on behalf of the trustees of a foundation called Munitalp to work on their newly-developed meteorological research program. For a time, Schaefer worked for both the Research Laboratory and Munitalp, but in 1954 he left the Research Laboratory to become the director of research for Munitalp. There Schaefer worked with the U.S. Forest Service in the northern Rocky Mountains on Project Skyfire, a program to determine the uses of cloud seeding to affect the patterns of lightning in thunderstorms (and the resulting forest fires started by lightning stikes). Project Skyfire had its roots in an association between the Forest Service and Schaefer begun in the early days of Project Cirrus. Schaefer also worked on developing a mobile atmospheric research laboratory and time-lapse films of clouds. Schaefer left Munitalp in 1958, turning down an offer to move with the organization to Kenya, but he remained an advisor to Munitalp for several years thereafter.</p><p> After leaving Munitalp, Schaefer's career turned toward scientific education. His own educational background left him with a firm belief in the power of independent learning and the importance of hands-on, practical experience. He worked with the American Meteorological Society and National Science Foundation on an educational film program and to develop what eventually became the Natural Sciences Institute (NSI) summer programs. The Atmospheric Sciences Program, as it was first known, gave high school students the opportunity to work with scientists while also conducting their own field research and experimentation. From 1959 to 1961 Schaefer was director of these summer sessions at the Loomis School in Connecticut. From 1962 to 1968 he continued the program under the auspices of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) at the State University of New York at Albany, where it became the NSI. During this period Schaefer also continued his consulting work for many companies, government agencies, and universities. These consulting activities spanned most of Schaefer's career and extended beyond his retirement from the ASRC in 1976.</p><p> While conducting the Atmospheric Sciences Program, Schaefer's work attracted the attention of Dean Oscar Lanford and President Evan Collins of the New York State Teachers College. They extended an invitation for Schaefer to come teach, which ultimately led to his founding of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center in 1961. Schaefer himself became director in 1966, a position he held for ten years before giving control to Volker Mohnen. Schaefer brought highly qualified atmospheric science researchers to the ASRC, many of whom he had met through his work at G.E. and Munitalp. Bernard Vonnegut, Raymond Falconer and Duncan Blanchard were all veterans of Project Cirrus who joined Schaefer at the University at Albany. In addition to the NSI summer programs, Schaefer led annual research expeditions to Yellowstone National Park for scientists to conduct field work in the vicinity of Old Faithful. In the 1970s Schaefer's other research interests focused on solar energy, aerosols, gases, air quality, and pollution particles in the atmosphere. His work in some of these areas culminated in a three-part report on "Air Quality on the Global Scale" in 1978. In addition, during the 1970s, Schaefer was an instructor in the American Association for the Advancement of Science Chautauqua short courses for science teachers. </p><p> During his retirement, Schaefer worked with photographer John Day on <emph render="italic">A Field Guide to the Atmosphere</emph> (1981), a publication in the Peterson <emph render="italic">Field Guide</emph> series. In addition to continuing his consulting work, Schaefer was in a position to devote much more of his time to some of his life-long interests such as environmental issues and natural and local history. This included the writing of numerous articles and the delivering of many presentations concerning the natural environment of upstate New York and the human impact on it. He also devoted much of his time to the fight for the preservation of many wilderness areas and parks, such as the Mohonk Preserve, Vrooman's Nose, and the Great Flats Aquifer. Schaefer's long-term interest in Dutch barns made it possible for him to assume the editorship of <emph render="italic">Dutch Barn Miscellany</emph> for a time and to build a scale model of a Dutch barn. He also did a lot of research on the original settler families of the Schenectady and Mohawk Valley areas. During his retirement, Schaefer reflected on his extraordinary life, preparing timelines, an unpublished autobiography, and indices to some of his research notebooks and film collections. Schaefer also attended to the disposition of his papers and library. He worked on a project he entitled "Ancient Windows of the Earth," which involved the slicing of rocks thinly so as to create a translucent look. When he mounted such pieces on lampshades or other objects, it created a stained-glass window effect from the natural rock layers, highlighting the rock's geologic history. As part of this project, Schaefer designed and built a window in memory of his parents for the Saint James Church in North Creek in the Adirondacks.</p><p> Schaefer married Lois Perret on July 27, 1935. Until their deaths they lived on Schermerhorn Road in Schenectady, in a house Schaefer built with his brothers, which they called Woestyne South. Woestyne North was the name the Schaefers gave to their camp in the Adirondacks. The Schaefers had three children, Susan, Katherine, and James. Vincent Schaefer passed away July 25, 1993 at the age of 87.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Vincent J. Schaefer Papers span Schaefer's young adult years all the way through his retirement after leaving the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the University of Albany. His professional papers also include General Electric, the Munitalp Foundation, the Loomis School, and independent consulting. Schaefer was particularly well known for his role as the scientist who discovered cloud seeding, a development that stemmed from work he did with precipitation and ice nuclei studies during World War II. Schaefer was also known for his studies of surface chemistry, solar energy, and aerosols, and was a driving force in the environmental movements of the 1960s through the 1980s. The collection includes documentation of all of these topics, not only by Schaefer but by colleagues with whom he worked closely.</p><p> Additionally, this collection contains files documenting Schaefer's myriad personal interests, many of which focus on outdoor activities and demonstrate his love of nature. Researchers will find that there is much crossover between Schaefer's professional pursuits and the activities he enjoyed in his spare time.</p><p> While there are many records in the collection such as research notes, letters, notebooks, and maps, Schaefer also donated many photographs and films of his work, particularly in the area of cloud seeding. While the bulk of the collection comprises his professional life, there are also many files demonstrating Schaefer's interests in local history, archaeology, and geography.</p><p> For related materials, please see the following collections held by the ME Grenander Department of Special Collection and Archives: Atmospheric Sciences Research Center Records (UA-450), which includes many publications and articles issued by the ASRC, Duncan Blanchard Papers (UA-902.065), Raymond Falconer Papers (UA-902.014) and Bernard Vonnegut Papers (APAP-UA-902.068)</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The overall arrangement of the Vincent Schaefer Papers is chronological in an attempt to show the order of his professional accomplishments. This arrangement, however, is not a perfect reflection of exact order because many of Schaefer's professional ventures crossed over with other projects. For example, he conducted independent consulting work while also involved with Munitalp and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, and his work with the Atmospheric Sciences Center for high school students began as an independent project at Connecticut's Loomis School before migrating with Schaefer to the New York State Teachers College (later the University at Albany).</p><p> Most of the files in the series and subseries of the Vincent Schaefer Papers are arranged in alphabetical order. Exceptions are the subseries that contain reports and publications, which are arranged chronologically. Documents published in the same time frame are in order alphabetically by title.</p>  </arrangement>

This series contains research notes, photographs, reports (published and unpublished, internal and external), and correspondence relating to all of his more famous experiments as well as a range of lesser-known work accomplished during his years at the G.E. Research Laboratory in Schenectady. The materials cover topics such as smoke/artificial fog generation, surface chemistry, studies of ice and snow particles, and early cloud seeding. The series is divided according to areas of specific interest to Schaefer as well as correspondence and publications. </p><p> Researchers looking for information on Project Cirrus will want to refer to Series #2, which is devoted entirely to notes, reports, and photos on that endeavor. However, any material not clearly and specifically identified by Schaefer as being Project Cirrus-related was not housed in that series; therefore it is likely that some correspondence and reports in Series #1 are in fact based in Project Cirrus. Researchers are encouraged to utilize both Series #1 and #2 if their interest lies with that project. Also notable is the fact that Schaefer was assigned to spend 50% of his work time on Project Cirrus, so although he was involved with that project for about five years, he did spend half of his time working on other tasks at G.E.'s research laboratory.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_bb43e6afe86818c2afa16615a1c58dc2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Ice and Snow Research</unittitle><unitid>1.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1932/1979" type="inclusive">1932-1979</unitdate><unitdate normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_f0b0c30331de0e0bd0f1ac38ac925e5c"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_ca14ed24b1e69faeffb46b1eb9a2a94e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The formation and behavior of snow and ice crystals were a lifelong interest of Schaefer's, and in his time at General Electric he was able to focus on the subject during the World War II years as ice related to the safety of U.S. Air Force planes. Schaefer and Irving Langmuir's interest in that topic grew as a result of their World War II-era contract work with the military, and the experiments they conducted after the war's end led directly to their Project Cirrus contract in 1947—an undertaking so extensive that their work in that area merited its own series in this collection. Much of their foundational work in snow and ice composition and behavior was grounded in observations and experiments conducted on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. Schaefer discovered during this time that ice crystals and snowflakes could be captured and observed using Formvar plastic. Using this method, he documented very specific data about ice and snow before creating some of the first replicas of specific snowflake shapes. The work of Schaefer and his colleagues regarding ice research includes handwritten notes, drawings, charts, photographs, reports, and correspondence specific to ice, snow, and Mount Washington.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_208c70061cb8ef5570fe00e1010d2707" level="file"><did><unittitle>Adams, John Mead- Review of Work</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce"

II. At that time they were under contract with the military for other weather-related reasons, but their research led them to wonder about the possibilities of controlling weather beyond military needs. Schaefer accomplished some of his most important foundational work with cloud seeding in 1946, before General Electric joined in another contract with the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Army Signal Corps. These records document some of Schaefer's initial work with cloud seeding, before the official birth of Project Cirrus. Researchers will also find about a dozen files on Project Blowdown, a cloud seeding operation conducted in Honduras to aid the United Fruit Company.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_1fd8bcdc240acd0e2ab19d589b5d3bb5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Committee on Weather Control</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1953/1954" type="inclusive">1953-1954</unitdate><container id="aspace_e0b2d3b3e5ced2be4990b56d19a5122e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_85bc199959a6275d08dc8c6cec3e5883" parent="aspace_e0b2d3b3e5ced2be4990b56d19a5122e" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f93b19b9ea2a579903d5018ede8c4e42" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Committee on Weather Control- Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1955/1955" type="inclusive">1955</unitdate><container id="aspace_ed37bf988c569dcfd0ad2ae16dca0b53" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_f29037f1135d8c0826f62bf9b8f34968" parent="aspace_ed37bf988c569dcfd0ad2ae16dca0b53" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6177a92a658f9d7197f9fd3399e193ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Committee on Weather Control- Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1956/1956" type="inclusive">1956</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_a42226211daa4d52217e0701167ddfd5" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_f2f0efe48de4f1efe6bf9bff9751d33b" parent="aspace_a42226211daa4d52217e0701167ddfd5" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_0c35c1b174db24dd97c187b7e9c43265" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Committee on Weather Control- Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1957/1957" type="inclusive">1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_0169b4e4c369f0c8fe042d055544b8c3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_41a09a0595bd5719e4b0b9ded94cd0ab" parent="aspace_0169b4e4c369f0c8fe042d055544b8c3" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_cc5f09a5f2fce29e9db31b39085ad7ea" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Committee on Weather Control- Reports</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1954/1954" type="inclusive">1954</unitdate><container id="aspace_f93302afde7bdaa1d9cab10007f647b9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_26ad4a3157fa6088ed1bc911fbe8ad6f" parent="aspace_f93302afde7bdaa1d9cab10007f647b9" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_41f25906568b06a50093aad98b052f4b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Anderson, Clinton P.- Weather Control Bill (with article by Schaefer)</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1950/1950" type="inclusive">1950</unitdate><container id="aspace_2b7fffbc3961688e9e793ab4a6a4ab76" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_0051c1d4868f756a1a41bad6051f342c" parent="aspace_2b7fffbc3961688e9e793ab4a6a4ab76" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7db6bbda6411da90ce15bb88cba22233" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cloud Code Chart</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1949/1949" type="inclusive">1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_e8bda6a5c41972da58d3f783a7e82edc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_4dd3b06b55e1ace3a7d398649ec743da" parent="aspace_e8bda6a5c41972da58d3f783a7e82edc" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_78f838b73b909f02fed3fe80121c9320" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cloud Droplet Research, Booted Cylinder, Negatives</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1945/1945" type="inclusive">1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_02e118f5d8d89245f3ada522a7581b31" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_70a58432fe2621685948132f65d2b218" parent="aspace_02e118f5d8d89245f3ada522a7581b31" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_fae67b0a64c6441151496379b146e1e3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cloud Meter</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1945/1946" type="inclusive">1945-1946</unitdate><container id="aspace_79a949e0fae1b5616130aa76ca794aa3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (1-General Electric- Non-Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_6ef350e057697d1b7ce084be98c6aab2" parent="aspace_79a949e0fae1b5616130aa76ca794aa3" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f1eb2064a1ea7f0f462758c2d8360443" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cloud Seeding Advice to W.D.

seeding or ice and snow research. These are the notes, graphs, drawings, and photographs of experiments that supported later discoveries in his larger projects. Notes and photos in this subseries include subjects such as surface tension, monomolecular layers, smoke generation, fog, uses of calgon, and electron microscopy. Also of note are his observations on precipitation and precipitation static, which he worked on with Irving Langmuir during World War II. While the bulk of the notes are Schaefer's own, there are also papers that belonged to Langmuir and various other scientists who shared observations with Schaefer.</p></scopecontent><c

They comprise their own subseries partly due to the fragile nature of the bindings, covers, and paper itself, but also because the nature of the bound books prevents their being divided among the categories of snow and ice research, cloud seeding, general research, etc. Researchers are encouraged to consult these notebooks for information on Schaefer's World War II projects, cloud seeding, surface chemistry, and more. Please note that Schaefer kept two sets of notebooks from 1940 to 1943—in addition to the larger hardback notebooks, he also kept a set of small softcover books that dealt with very specific topics such as smoke filters and artificial fog. He also used some of the smaller-size notebooks for scientific observations from his own home.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_361275a5b7fe0a8e98449401cff0784d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Research

They include letters sent and received by Schaefer as well as some to and from Irving Langmuir. Schaefer also retained letters that were to and from others at General Electric but carbon copied to him. While most of Schaefer's letters came to the archives grouped in large, general batches, some were retained separate from the larger groups. The archivist kept that arrangement, which is why certain letters are foldered individually or in very small groups while the majority of this subseries is simply categorized as "general".</p><p> Due to time constraints, correspondence that might relate to Project Cirrus was not culled from this series to be placed in Series #2, so researchers might wish to peruse this subseries for Cirrus letters, especially those two and from various branches of the military.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_be95d93f5a0aa0c194e611b49be5b1fe" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aerological Instruments- Recommendations (I.

These files include research notes from sources other than General Electric; scientists and entrepreneurs frequently exchanged results of their work with one another, but to avoid confusion, the work of Schaefer and other G.E. scientists can be found in the next subseries while informal research notes and observations by others are located here.</p></scopecontent><c

Many are from his early days at General Electric when he was still a research assistant, covering topics such as surface chemistry. Any articles co-written by Schaefer and his colleagues are included in this subseries. Some articles and reports do discuss early cloud seeding issues but do not appear to be directly related to Project Cirrus. When in doubt, the archivist looked for credits or acknowledgements to the U.S. military to help determine how a certain article or report should be categorized. Please note that many of the articles are reprints, which are reflected in the folder dates. Some folders also include manuscripts of the published articles or reports, which is indicated in the folder title.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_768efb462e2f0b8b9b3b5d8ae71d33b3" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Composition of Fatty Acid on Water Containing Calcium or Barium Salts"- I.

In his introduction, he writes that "[Project Cirrus] was very complex, with a number of subdivisions associated with the main activity. Some of these subdivisions ran consecutively, some operated in parallel, and others intertwined or branched off in variously divergent directions." This preface is relevant to Schaefer's own collection of materials because the "intertwined" nature of Cirrus itself, as well as its roots in Schaefer and Langmuir's previous work, sometimes made it difficult for the archivist to separate Project Cirrus documents from materials that related to cloud seeding efforts but were not strictly part of the work done under the government contract that defined Project Cirrus. </p><p> The archivist made every attempt to be strict with materials placed into the Project Cirrus series, using dates, acknowledgements to the military, and the Army Signal Corp's own stamp to help identify documents as Project Cirrus when needed. Researchers may find it helpful to consult the cloud seeding materials in Series #1 for items documenting the events that led to the project's founding.</p><p> Project Cirrus bloomed from multiple experiments that converged late in 1946. Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir did extensive work for the United States military during World War II. Among their projects was the issue of precipitation static interfering with U.S. Airforce pilots' ability to fly and land safely. (See Series #1, General Electric) Their efforts to deal with the problem took them to the peak of New Hampshire's Mount Washington, where Schaefer and Langmuir observed behaviors of snow and ice crystals that were relevant to their current work but also gave them ideas for future research regarding supercooled water droplets.</p><p> When their contracts with the U.S. military ran out shortly after World War II, Schaefer and Langmuir continued studying behaviors of snow and ice particles in earnest. Schaefer discovered that he could use a type of special plastic called Formvar to capture and preserve snowflakes, some of which can be found in Series #1. These experiments led Schaefer to investigate further the behavior of particles in cloud formations. On a hot July day in 1946, while working with a cold chamber, Schaefer accidentally discovered that the use of dry ice in a supercooled cloud would form instant ice crystals. Drs. Irving Langmuir and Bernard Vonnegut added their expertise to the process, working with silver iodide as well as dry ice. In no time they worked out the potential effects of their discovery on weather modification, and the seeds of Project Cirrus were firmly planted.</p><p> Ultimately, on November 13, 1946, Schaefer led a successful cloud seeding expedition over Mount Greylock in Massachusetts. His efforts convinced the U.S. military to sign a contract with General Electric yet again early in 1947. This time, it was a mutual agreement between G.E., the Army Signal Corps of Engineers, the Air Force, and the Office of Naval Research. The government hoped that fruitful cloud seeding experimentation would open doors for agricultural success and even improved safety for the people of the United States. The project sponsored well over 150 flights as well as ground operations, with 1948-1950 being the major years for flights conducted. Besides basic cloud seeding work, they also experimented with hurricane seeding and wildfire fighting in the fall of 1947. The project wrapped up in September 1952 when the Airforce pilots began to be called away to Korea, and the G.E. team decided they had gone as far as they could with their work.</p><p> This series is divided into three parts: flight data and research, subject files, and reports and publications. Each one highlights various aspects of G.E.'s efforts to work with the military as they explored cloud seeding options in the late 1940s and early 1950s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_afce3aed025861c5e4c99994e2ec5e30" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Flight Data and Research</unittitle><unitid>2.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1946/1953" type="inclusive">1946-1953</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_d6ac9f00c240dbc6c2112a49ac8e7d56"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged Alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_64dcc7cf6736f80e5a361e45e70b3e7b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains materials on specific flights, though the availability of data ranges from a single page for some flights to multiple pages with photos for other flights. Each one is labeled by flight number, where it took place, what operation was performed, and on what date. There are also files on research efforts that took place on the ground and in the lab, including charts, diagrams, weather observations, and research notebooks. Photographs include particular flights, most of which feature aerial cloud views, but there are also general photos that were not labeled by Schaefer or his colleagues.</p><p> Researchers will also find documents on two extra Project Cirrus missions, one dealing with Hurricane King and the other with Operation Red. Both pursuits took place in the fall of 1947. The former related to cloud seeding a hurricane in order to expend its energy before it made landfall while Operation Red focused on cloud seeding over wildfires in New England. The Hurricane King effort is not to be confused with the Hurricane King of 1950; the Project Cirrus crew named the 1947 hurricane on their own but did not have a title from official weather bureaus.</p><p> Please note that Schaefer's preliminary materials on cloud seeding, as well as data and photos from his 1946 cloud seeding flights, are located in Series #1 because they took place before the official creation of Project Cirrus in 1947.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_14d5f5cbce64430f31e8162ccfb64d9d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Adiabatic Diagrams</unittitle><unitdate

Project Cirrus, but not to specific flights. Photos include equipment, precipitation, general cloud photos, and Schaefer appearing at functions during the Cirrus years. Researchers will also find some data on cloud seeding endeavors elsewhere, such as California and Sydney, Australia. Correspondence files do exist within this subseries, but researchers might also want to consult the correspondence files in Series #1 for the years 1947 to 1952 as it is likely that Schaefer kept Cirrus letters with his other General Electric correspondence. Other documents include news clippings, bulletins from meteorological conferences, and weather radar reports from MIT.</p><p> One highlight of the subject files is the material on Project Blowdown. Unlike Hurricane King and Operation Red, which were direct offshoots of Project Cirrus, Project Blowdown was a side project of Irving Langmuir's in which he was advisor to Joe Silverthorne, a commercial seeder acting on behalf of the United Fruit Company.

id="aspace_e1e7187d93f72796fa23f7ac7a4367d4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These are the articles and reports dealing specifically with Project Cirrus-related matters. Some are direct reports to the government regarding progress made while others were published in research journals for purposes of letting the outside world know what the Cirrus team was accomplishing. The subseries includes some drafts as well as the finished products. Researchers might find General Electric's "Project Cirrus: The Story of Cloud Seeding" (Nov. 1952) and Barrington Havens' "History of Project Cirrus" (1952) to be particularly useful summaries.</p><p> As noted in Series #1, Subseries #7, it was not always immediately clear to the archivist if a specific publication should be categorized as Project Cirrus or not. In those cases, the archivist looked for dates, credits or acknowledgements to the U.S. military, or footnotes regarding military contract numbers, to decide where the article or report should be filed. Schaefer spent 50% of his work hours on Project Cirrus so the fact that a document falls in the Cirrus date range does not automatically mean that it was a product of that pursuit.</p><p> Special note: Occasional Report #23 is dated before #22, and the same situation is true for Occasional Reports #8 and #9. The archivist has left them in numeric order despite the reversed dates.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_286687f5beb2465913a2f2e9cb80d51f" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Development of Hypsometer Method of Atmospheric Pressure Measurement- First Monthly Progress Report" by GE for US Signal Corps</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1946-11/1946-11" type="inclusive">1946 November</unitdate><container id="aspace_c9a96c903ce9d9df3b06271bcfb710ad" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">10 (2-General Electric- Project Cirrus)</container><container id="aspace_62f7c78702d668493040ab4399d7c27b" parent="aspace_c9a96c903ce9d9df3b06271bcfb710ad" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_60f5a37606034fdcabf96171649f6660" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Nucleation of Ice Formation by Silver Iodide" B.

The day-to-day routine in the research lab at General Electric was changing from the way it was in the days of Willis Whitney, so in 1951 Schaefer began scaling back his hours at G.E. to collaborate with Munitalp's board of trustees. By 1954, Schaefer was ready to make a complete break from G.E. to become Munitalp's director of research.</p><p> Munitalp's main focus was meteorological research, specifically cloud physics. Three advisors helped formulate the group's goals in the early fifties: Svere Petterssen, Horace Byers, and Vincent Schaefer, all of whom came from respected scientific backgrounds. As director of research, Schaefer brought some unexplored ideas from Project Cirrus to the table, ideas that were given time and attention under the resources provided by Munitalp. In collaboration with Director Vernon Crudge, Schaefer oversaw research efforts that expanded throughout the United States and beyond. Munitalp not only sponsored its own original experiments, but also guided grant-funded projects by other organizations having an interest in meteorological work. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the University of Hokkaido (Japan), the University of Stockholm, and Mount Washington Observatory are just a few of the many institutions that collaborated with Munitalp</p><p> Two of the best-known research projects to come from Munitalp are Project Skyfire, which dealt with lightning-induced forest fires in the American Northwest, and the first use of time-lapse films to track cloud formations. The former attempted to use cloud seeding technology to reduce risks of forest fires while the latter provided a whole new understanding of everything from jet stream cloud behavior to development of low-lying fog-- information used by the American Meteorological Society as well as flight crews of the world's major airlines.</p><p> The Munitalp Foundation moved its headquarters to Africa in the late 1950s, and while Schaefer traveled there to oversee the transfer, he decided not to remain as director of research. Though he officially left the Foundation in 1958, he maintained an advisory role for several years thereafter.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_093e4b58ee4a43e555180ad4b0ef5845" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>General Research</unittitle><unitid>3.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1948/1964" type="inclusive">1948-1964</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_766bfcea202f44b247c71994eee5046d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_828482a802980d4c879d68c8738ebd3d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>General research essentially covers all documents not dealing with Project Skyfire. Since Munitalp's purpose was to aid other organizations with their meteorological experiments, it had many different projects under its wing. Schaefer's papers in this area deal mainly with jet stream and cloud studies and weather modification. One specific example of a new weather modification experiment was Project Shower, which took Schaefer to Hawaii to work with the Pineapple Institute. Some of the files are reminiscent of his work at General Electric since his fascination with particle studies continued well beyond his days in the Knolls Research Laboratory. There are documents and photographs dealing with clouds, precipitation, and atmospheric particles, including some from Mount Washington since Schaefer continued to foster a working relationship with the lab there. Time lapse films of clouds and cloud formations were also a ground-breaking aspect of Schaefer's work with Munitalp.</p><p> There are also some files on the mobile lab that Schaefer engineered, an idea that followed him after Munitalp when he went to other institutions. Researchers will find somewhat less extensive field notes in this subseries than in General Electric, which may be a reflection of Schaefer's increased administrative role with Munitalp.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2509807a7ae89a39fe687e3bc84d9c2d" level="file"><did><unittitle>200-300 Millibar Analyses</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1953/1953"

was Project Skyfire. Schaefer became familiar with the problem of lightning-induced forest fires while he was still working at G.E., but it wasn't until he transferred to Munitalp that he could give the issue direct attention. Working alongside Harry Gisborne, chief of fire research in Missoula, Montana, Schaefer researched the use of cloud seeding techniques in changing patterns of lightning storms in the northwestern United States. This subseries contains the data, charts, maps, and photographs from this project.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_24d23da4dbd4a9abbcbd1c5b7940647f" level="file"><did><unittitle>American

The substantial amount of correspondence that he kept from his Munitalp years shows the greatly increased administrative role he held in comparison to his General Electric days.</p><p> The letters include letters directed to him alone, letters that colleagues sent to one another but also carbon copied to Schaefer, and carbon copies of correspondence that Schaefer sent out. Most of these files came to the archives bundled together without labels or other identification, while some were singled out by specific people or topics. The archivist kept that arrangement, so researchers will find most of the letters filed under the name "general" and identified by year. Others are titled by a particular person's name or subject as well as the year. All of the correspondence is arranged chronologically.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_a6e4e581dc2a8d71c921a73fa0837284" level="file"><did><unittitle>Africa</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian"

weather research activities of groups not affiliated with Munitalp. This subseries also includes administrative files such as personnel information, grant writing endeavors, and budgeting, which are reflections of Schaefer's role as director of research.

Materials cover a range of topics including Project Skyfire, jet stream studies, cloud seeding, particle studies, and research on the relationship between environmental factors and the weather. Since this subseries is comparatively smaller than the reports and publications for General Electric, works by Schaefer and others are mixed together. The files are arranged chronologically, then alphabetically by article/report title if necessary. Folder titles note the author of each work. For Schaefer's writings, the archivist noted if there is a manuscript included with the published copy.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_1d250f1df24f0c9b7e700238b6e7d247" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A Proposed Program for the Munitalp Foundation," V.J.

It was through the A.M.S. that Schaefer became a certified meteorological consultant. A highly diverse selection of institutions and individuals sought Schaefer's advice; his name and work began to be widely known during his General Electric days and continued to be recognized (and respected) when he was director of research for Munitalp.</p><p> This series is divided into two subseries because the archivist found the materials divided between pure correspondence and other materials (such as reports or minutes) that had correspondence intermixed. Schaefer's secretary, Alice Klopfer, handled administrative matters for him during his busiest consulting years and the archivist believes that the materials in the correspondence subseries were arranged in their current manner by Ms. Klopfer. In the interests of preserving that original state, the archivist did not add letters to those files during the processing of the remaining consulting materials. Therefore, researchers should note that correspondence can be found in both subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_4457bcb74ca8d34c0daaa89a70ea7627" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>4.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1950/1968" type="inclusive">1950-1968</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_84bd47c27a2ba125a241643e305f00f5"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_7651bbed68a436c5d981fae9beb3089f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The correspondence in this subseries is a mix of letters received by Schaefer as well as carbon copies of letters sent by him or his secretary, Alice Klopfer. The archivist believes that the filing system used in this subseries was created by Ms. Klopfer and has been preserved accordingly. Most folders are titled by the name of the person or company for whom Schaefer was consulting, but there are also files titled simply by letter of the alphabet—these contain correspondence from sources that were not numerous enough to warrant their own folders, and are identified within each folder by subject.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_65cdf848aeafcac2925cd5c5a0fd4298" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A" Files</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1964-11/1967-12" type="inclusive">1964 November-1967 December</unitdate><container id="aspace_d273fc8c31f2c742e99a151eddae7b55" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Consulting)</container><container id="aspace_a83b68f3e19eaec3bc2b0ec0dbc39f08" parent="aspace_d273fc8c31f2c742e99a151eddae7b55" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_acb3a72386416d0e39271e7e56225fd9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Air Research &amp; Development Command, 1956</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1956-04/1956-11" type="inclusive">1956 April-1956 November</unitdate><container id="aspace_084dca5a770f30093d1decad901715fb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Consulting)</container><container id="aspace_ad5eaf590aa197191a700b23e385cd2d" parent="aspace_084dca5a770f30093d1decad901715fb" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c02abe107a84d7a8c897a9a0072e8b9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arthur D.

They decided on the existing Loomis School in Windsor, Connecticut as the location for their summer program, which began in 1959 with the support of the National Science Foundation. Schaefer and his colleagues wanted to give academically strong students with a particular interest in science the opportunity to attend extra lectures and, more importantly, experiment with hands-on projects of their choosing. Schaefer and his AMS associates hoped to cultivate a love of learning and passion for discovery that would encourage teens to follow scientific career paths. Although the program began as a males-only endeavor, it eventually welcomed females into its ranks later in the 1960s.</p><p> The Loomis School summer sessions (also known as the Atmospheric Sciences Program) became so successful that the Charles F. Kettering Foundation gave it financial backing in the early 1960s. As director, Schaefer was then able to expand the program to include field stations around the country so that more young people could participate and the opportunities for hands-on experimentation and discovery multiplied considerably. Within a couple of years of the program's beginning, Schaefer's work attracted the attention of Dean Oscar Lanford and President Evan Collins of what was then the New York State Teachers College. As the Teachers College expanded into the present-day State University of New York at Albany in the 1960s, the summer science program moved under the auspices of the school and became known as the Natural Sciences Institute, or NSI, which flourished through the 1960s as it welcomed college students to its ranks. Schaefer phased out the NSI in the early 1970s after determining that the program had met its goals.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ee4e39d562b2a7c7b6d289647f9ed366" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>American Meteorological Society</unittitle><unitid>5.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1949/1980" type="inclusive">1949-1980</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_6611775cdfe8a0ffe8b7593e475dfb1d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged Alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_8de2a1c7598cdba3b9749db4609c26ae"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In addition to serving on the Education Committee of the American Meteorological Society, Schaefer also served on the general council of the AMS. This subseries features documents on the AMS educational films project, correspondence, a few AMS bulletins, and some programs from annual AMS meetings. Although the files do not directly relate to the founding of the Loomis School/NSI, the AMS was responsible for the founding of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the Loomis School in 1959, and the documentation of educational programs found in this subseries foreshadows the creation of those summer sessions.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_874f48dbf396d972fc1a4caa9182805a"

Contents</head><p>As director of the Loomis School activities, and ultimately as director of research at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York, Albany, Schaefer kept records pertaining to the operation of the program. There are many correspondence files; some are between Schaefer and colleagues while others are between Schaefer and the students from the summer program. Numerous students kept in touch with Schaefer well beyond the years that they participated in the Atmospheric Sciences Program, and many of them became successful professionals in their own right. </p><p> Researchers will also find curriculum planning documents, teaching aids, field site information, and applications and invitation reply forms from students. Please note that some folders in this subseries are restricted due to individual student information contained therein.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_fbe0ada30024acfdb23485d7363412c4"

While Schaefer, as director, would make appearances and coordinate the activities at each site—called field stations—the day-to-day running of each one depended on the talent of the highly reputable scientists Schaefer hired for that purpose. Initially, the field stations were located in New York (Whiteface Mountain), Colorado (Boulder), and Arizona (Flagstaff). Eventually, more sites were added, including Socorro, New Mexico and Rensselaerville, New York. Schaefer's contacts from General Electric and Munitalp played a helpful role in establishing field stations and attracting accomplished staff members for the summer program.</p><p> The files in this

some of their final papers that detail the projects they worked on for eight weeks. Encouraged by Schaefer to do self-directed experiments, the students kept logs of observations and measurements to aid them in their final reports to staff and peers. A few also sketched illustrations to accompany their notes. Some of the papers in this subseries are final reports of the students' experiments while others are thoughts and reflections on the experience as a whole.</p></scopecontent><c

When Schaefer began the highly successful Atmospheric Physics Program via the Loomis School in Connecticut, he attracted the attention of Dean Oscar Lanford and President Evan Collins of the New York State Teachers College. They asked Schaefer to come teach at their Albany school, and within his first year as a faculty member, the idea for the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) was born. Officially established in February 1961, it was originally located in the old General Electric hangar at Schenectady Airport. Although the former New York State Teachers College expanded to the current uptown Albany campus in the mid-1960s, officially becoming the University at Albany, State University of New York, the ASRC remained centered in Schenectady at that time. Meanwhile, the Atmospheric Physics Program that began at the Loomis School shifted to Albany to be under the sponsorship of the ASRC, where it became the Natural Sciences Institute (NSI). However, since the program's roots were not originally with the ASRC and University at Albany, those records comprise their own series within this collection (Series #5).</p><p> The ASRC was designed in memory of the atmosphere that Schaefer enjoyed at the General Electric Research Laboratory in the 1930s and 1940s, where scientists were allowed plenty of freedom to conduct their experiments and Director Willis Whitney asked each day if his researchers were having fun. Besides conducting their own original research, ASRC scientists were always in contact with other professionals around the United States and internationally, sharing their research and collaborating on new ideas. The Center was also an ideal location for budding scientists from the University at Albany to collaborate with professionals. Schaefer brought some of the best scientists of the day to the ASRC thanks to his contacts from General Electric and Munitalp. Ray Falconer, Bernard Vonnegut, and Duncan Blanchard all became part of the ASRC family as it grew from the G.E. airplane hangar, to a building at 100 Fuller Road by the SUNY Albany uptown campus (1978), and finally to 251 Fuller Road (1997) where it is part of the Center for Environmental Sciences and Technology Management (CESTM).</p><p> Although Schaefer was the principle founder of the ASRC, Dr. David Barry and Dr. Eugene McLaren were among the first directors while Schaefer was director of research (and chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee.) However, Schaefer became overall director in 1965, a position he held until his retirement from the ASRC and teaching in 1976. Given the title of Professor Emeritus, he remained an advisor to the ASRC for years after.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_09f40cdd493555b606c69b7a5ad80157" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Administrative Files</unittitle><unitid>6.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1954/1990" type="inclusive">1954-1990</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_1a9ff4fb5148ae4f8f3d020e241d608a"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_08574c4cde1a0dcfcf56a6a1cd48d213"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The majority of the administrative files consist of correspondence; as director of research and then overall director of the ASRC, Schaefer was in constant contact with administrators of SUNY Albany, local colleagues, and other professionals in the field.

national and even international implications as environmental concerns became more public in the 1960s and 1970s. He was engaged frequently to speak about his research, both to other professionals and to "everyday" people who might be interested in learning more about issues like acid rain or solar energy. He also participated on committees and commissions who were given the responsibility of investigating scientific dilemmas of the day and presenting findings to the government. This subseries contains materials from those speaking engagements, trips, and committees.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_7e420646444216d8752ea1bdefce9826" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph

In addition to experiments carried out in New York's Capital Region, he oversaw research at the Whiteface Mountain Field Station and Observatory as well as Flagstaff, Arizona, and led highly successful expeditions in the Yellowstone National Park. His fascination with particle studies continued during his ASRC years, leading to crucial investigations of carcinogens, acid rain, effects of particulate matter on global weather, aerosol studies, and much more. He also took great interest in alternative energy sources, solar energy specifically. Of course, cloud studies and ice-forming nuclei also remained a passion of Schaefer's. This subseries mainly consists of Schaefer's own investigations into those kinds of topics and offers a glimpse of his own notes, calculations, and observations on the subjects of interest to him.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_48eb22d4b0a39d7e88f3ac9d4bd60f92" level="file"><did><unittitle>Acid Rain</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1974/1984"

of the University of Nevada (currently called the Nevada System of Higher Education). Their mission calls for a blend of traditional, basic research with interdisciplinary, applied research methods. Although Schaefer did not have a hand in creating the D.R.I., he did act as a consultant for them during his time at the ASRC/SUNY. His Natural Sciences Institute also expanded to include a field station at the D.R.I., so this subseries is a blend of Schaefer's consulting materials as well as applications and curriculum planning for the N.S.I. summer programs.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_c7c21150ef631992f7d2a0753c2a935b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Administrative Materials- National Advisory Board, Meetings, Summer

Contents</head><p>Among Schaefer's most successful ventures via the ASRC was the Yellowstone Field Expeditions. In 1960, Schaefer met with National Park Service members in Wyoming's Grand Tetons to discuss the possibility of leading scientific studies in Yellowstone National Park. Specifically, he was interested in the behavior of supercooled clouds that form in the area of Old Faithful. Clouds and condensation nuclei were still a fascination of Schaefer's long after his G.E. days, and he foresaw many different kinds of scientists—including cloud physicists—gathering at Yellowstone once a year to devote themselves to conducting experiments, making observations, and comparing outcomes.</p><p> January 1961 saw the first Yellowstone Field Research Expedition (YFRE) come and go with great success. Schaefer took care to invite scientists who likely knew each other by reputation but had not had the chance to meet, thereby cementing new professional relationships as well as friendships. He also tried to invite scientists of all ages and backgrounds so that new professionals would benefit from the experience of those who were more seasoned, and scientists from assorted specialties could share their expertise all around. Generally, the expeditions began shortly after the new year and lasted four weeks. Participants could stay all month or come for a portion of it. </p><p> As founder of the program, Schaefer nearly always stayed the entire time, with the exception of the last couple of years when he left early to see if the remainder of the expedition would run smoothly without him. While the program ran efficiently in terms of the participants involved, atmospheric conditions had changed since Yellowstone officials began allowing snowmobiles in the park in 1965. The effect on the environment was detrimental to the scientists' studies, and drastic changes in the administration of the park added to the YFRE woes. The last expedition occurred in 1971 despite Schaefer's original intentions to continue the program. He shifted studies to Northern Arizona and Southern Utah in the summertime for purposes of analyzing air pollution and land use, but that program lasted just two years.</p><p> This subseries contains administrative papers dealing with the operation of the YFRE as well as Schaefer's own notes, calculations, and photographs of his work at the Yellowstone National Park. Although there is a separate subseries for ASRC reports and publications, those pertaining specifically to the Field Expeditions are included in this subseries. Please note that there are two photo albums in this subseries that are housed in a separate, oversized box.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_216076478d6e842bf6ea84d38f4fbced"

collaborated with the ASRC. Names from the latter group will sound familiar from Schaefer's consulting materials, such as Wendell Mordy and Paul MacCready. Topics range from annual ASRC reports, to solar energy work, to particle studies and more. Some documents are official reprints of articles while others are handwritten manuscripts or typescripts.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ce37adcb0f4b92bc23c90ef7902cfc6e" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Why be a Spelunker?"

Topics include the environment, chemistry, electrostatics, ice and snow, and world travel. While some of the images in this subseries are directly related to Schaefer's professional work, others are likely derived from extracurricular activities he engaged in while taking photographs for business purposes. Schaefer never did like to let an opportunity go by to explore things that were of interest to him. Some topics, like the Yellowstone Field Expedition, exist as their own subseries elsewhere. In the interests of preserving original order, however, those images were not pulled from this subseries.</p><p> Researchers might note that the dates of this subseries span far more than Schaefer's ASRC years. Although some of the photos, slides, and negatives are from G.E., Munitalp, and consulting jobs, Schaefer certainly drew upon his past resources while working for the University at Albany/ASRC. He also stayed on in an advisory capacity after his official retirement, which is why there are images that post-date 1976.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_e4b752d6f697f867e311dbfd730cf105"

Contents</head><p>In 1964 The Institute on Man and Science in Rensselaerville, New York invited Vincent Schaefer to serve on the faculty of scientists and humanists for its July summer program. Established in 1962 as an educational center to encourage life-long learning and explore ideas about human problems, the Institute changed its name in the 1980s to The Rensselaerville Institute to reflect its broader focus on local self–help programs, small town revitalization efforts, innovation in government, and cultural and educational programs. The Institute remains in existence today. In addition to Schaefer, participants and faculty of the Institute on Man and Science included a Supreme Court Justice, Nobel Prize recipients, award-winning authors, scientists, economists, and a former Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p><p> This initial invitation in 1964 led to a three decades-long relationship between the Institute, Schaefer, and his wife Lois. Based upon his experiences on the 1964 summer program faculty, Schaefer subsequently established a Natural Sciences Institute field unit in Rensselaerville the following year. Students attended all of the 1965 summer program lectures at The Institute on Man and Science. Schaefer continued to serve as a faculty member for educational programs, was on the Research and Development Committee, advised the Institute about science more generally, became an Associate of the Institute in 1971, and by the mid-1970s began many years of service on the Board of Trustees.</p><p> This series includes materials related to Schaefer's varied and long-term service to the Institute. There is correspondence, both general and Trustee-specific, literature about the Institute and its programs, and a small number of newsletters. There are Trustee semi-annual meeting materials, the majority kept by Schaefer in the form of complete meeting packages given to Trustees during the Spring or Fall meeting. There are minutes from the Executive and Finance Committees, some of which Schaefer saved individually, and others he kept within the Trustee meeting packets. In addition, Schaefer retained reports about the Institute's community renewal work in small towns, including Stump Creek, Pennsylvania and Corbett, New York.</p><p> Please note that not all dates are inclusive and see Series 8, Subseries 1 for documents relating to the Natural Sciences Institute field unit in Rensselaerville.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_4d52e887b1d180da0c611aceecacf819"

interests and professional pursuits is environmental activism. Schaefer had a devotion to the outdoors from a very young age, both in terms of participating in recreational activities and regarding conservation efforts. His choice of atmospheric science and chemistry as his profession gave him the opportunity not only to spend extra time out in the elements, but also offered the chance to become an expert in environmental issues that he could then pursue in his spare time. The materials in this subseries highlight some of the activities and issues that most captured Schaefer's interest.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_a21d06a7cf47f6999afc48fbe62edb9a" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>The Huyck Preserve</unittitle><unitid>8.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1940/1988" type="inclusive">1940-1988</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_74dc15aa6de1baa029c82e1a88d5fc00"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_9560a98d8ff852152b5fcdd16c6bc82d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Located in Rensselaerville, New York, the widow and heirs of local businessman E.N. Huyck established the Edmund Niles Preserve and Biological Research Station in his memory in 1931. This non-profit organization remains dedicated to preservation, education and research and to offering visitors a tranquil setting.</p><p> Vincent Schaefer was actively involved with the Huyck Preserve and part of its decision-making process for many decades. He joined the Scientific Advisory Committee of the organization in the mid-1950s and was elected to the Board of Directors for the first time in 1971. He also headed the Long-Range Planning Committee in the early- to mid-1980s.</p><p> This series documents Schaefer's ongoing activities with the Huyck Preserve. There are minutes, agenda and correspondence related to his committee and Board service. Many of these records discuss land preservation and maintenance. The Scientific Advisory Committee also selected summer PhD researchers from applications submitted by faculty at colleges and universities across the country, and there are records reflecting this process in the subseries. Of interest to researchers may be documents addressing the founding of the Natural Sciences Institute field unit in Rensselaerville in 1965, a topic related to The Institute on Man and Science (Series 7) as well.</p><p> Please note that not all dates are inclusive.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_7ede222cae25037ab811c2abafefbe40" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Meeting Agenda, Minutes, and

id="aspace_6aa371bbd434b6709653e125de7c8626"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In late 1974 Vincent Schaefer began conducting air quality studies in the Shawangunk Moutains of New York, located 90 miles north of New York City, as part of his research at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. This was his first visit to the Mohonk Preserve, then known as The Mohonk Trust.</p><p> The origins of the Preserve extend back to 1869, when the Smiley family purchased Mohonk Lake and later established the Mohonk Mountain House. In 1963 Smiley family members and several House guests established a separate non-profit organization, The Mohonk Trust, to protect and manage the land for public enjoyment and conservation. The Trust, renamed the Mohonk Preserve in 1978, was the first land trust with the mission of protecting the Shawangunk Ridge and one of the oldest land conservation organizations in the Hudson Valley.</p><p> Schaefer's air quality research introduced him to the Smiley family and he took an active interest in Mohonk during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. He was elected to the Board of Trustees of The Mohonk Trust in early 1977. He later was a member of the Board of Directors of the Monhonk Preserve, serving on the Science and Long-Range Planning Committees.</p><p> This series features materials related to Schaefer's service as a trustee, director, and committee member.

The town ultimately approved a new nearby site, and Wilmonite developed the Rotterdam Square Mall, which opened in 1988. However, during the intervening years, Schaefer and many other residents were adamantly opposed to the Mall, citing environmental, economic and cultural concerns. Schaefer was a member of The Society for the Preservation of Water Resources, Inc., which formed in 1981, to protect the area's water resources and educate citizens about potential hazards that might affect drinking water. The Society included many fellow scientists and engineers with technical backgrounds that could conduct their own studies and explain the implications to area residents. Schaefer also feared the Mall's impact on historic sites that must be torn down or be otherwise adversely affected by the new Mall, the potential for flooding, the issues with water runoff, and the decision to build the Mall in a suburban area rather than revitalize downtown Schenectady businesses.</p><p> The subseries includes Schaefer's scientific studies, his historic surveys and research, correspondence, especially his letters to the editor, his 1979 newspaper series in the Schenectady Gazette designed to educate fellow residents about the importance of the Great Flats Aquifer, newspaper clippings, maps and photographs. Very few of these materials were initially in folders so the archivist elected to retain the small number of folders and titles and then arranged the remainder of the materials in chronological order in folders labeled Great Flats Aquifer.</p><p> Please see the finding aid for APAP-061 for the records of the Society for the Preservation of Water Resources for more specific information about this not-for-profit organization.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f244910c20818da610e726b51f007756" level="file"><did><unittitle>Genealogical Lists and Charts of Early Inhabitants of Great

id="aspace_fc3340765d44d3a0862377a9be14a429"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries includes files documenting Vincent Schaefer's varied environmental and outdoor activities that are not associated with a particular organization, such as the Huyck Preserve or Mohonk, or a specific legal effort like the fight to preserve the Great Flats Aquifer. Materials include maps, correspondence, photographs, draft manuscripts, and news clippings. Of interest are folders devoted to the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club, which Schaefer helped found, and his vision for the Long Path, which he saw as a trail for hikers stretching from northern New Jersey through the Adirondacks passing landmarks along the way. Schaefer published articles in this subseries as an individual who loved, studied and appreciated nature, and not as a scientist for General Electric, Munitalp, or the ASRC. Therefore articles in this series span his lifetime. Researchers should note his "Five Rivers Rambles" ongoing series for the Knickerbocker News, written during the early 1970s. In his column, Schaefer explored timely topics, such as air pollution, but also area locations of natural beauty and wonder, including Gore Mountain, the Helderbergs, and Pine Plains.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_55324f3ea28032ac6f93c2a7840d461a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Acid Rain</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1982/1984"

Atmospheric Sciences Research Center. Having a love and deep respect for the outdoors from a young age, Schaefer participated in organized activities like the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club, but he also incorporated spontaneous outdoor adventures into his busy schedule whenever he could. Sometimes this meant a day or afternoon exploring areas in and around the Capital Region; other times it meant taking time to explore while he was away on business. His work for General Electric, Munitalp, and the State University at Albany/ASRC (not to mention his extensive consulting) offered ample opportunities to venture into mountain ranges, deserts, plains, valleys, and forests to pursue environmental studies that were of interest to him.</p><p> This subseries includes many photo negatives and slides in addition to traditional photographs and are identified as such in their folder titles.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_041a6194aa834cf26bbfdb36d0db5a11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Adirondack Trail Club- photos</unittitle><unitdate

id="aspace_d75012b2de452217b4e637c1c9c9b01a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The location of correspondence in this collection is based on how the archivist found the materials as donated by Schaefer. Although he filed a considerable amount of correspondence within materials from specific affiliations (ex. General Electric, Munitalp, consulting work), the archivist found still more correspondence boxed separately. Roughly half of these items were not subdivided or specially categorized in any way while others were foldered by topic. This arrangement has been retained by the archivist. Please note that this series contains letters, cards, and postcards that span the majority of Schaefer's life, from young adulthood to the weeks before he died in July 1993. Some are professional in nature while others are from friends and family.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_b18cf9571614ffb61efe39cc86c46425" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><unitid>9.1</unitid><unitdate normal="1923/1993" type="inclusive">1923-1993</unitdate><unitdate normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_856efa78b12fa56402b610a0b06ec317"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged chronologically</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_faffdfddc2a1de460cb6685b31b72439"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These letters were not previously sorted out by Schaefer before he donated them to the archive, and like the correspondence in subseries #1, they span many years and have their source in many of Schaefer's professional and personal activities.

Correspondence shows that he brought the idea to Houghton Mifflin Editor-in-Chief Paul Brooks in the mid-1950s (Box 1, Folder 40) but the book was not finished at that point. Later, Schaefer collaborated with Professor John A. Day of Linfield College, Oregon and Christy Day for the final version of the book. Much of their correspondence regarding drafts is preserved in this series. The finished product, <title><emph render="italic">A Field Guide to the Atmosphere</emph></title>, was published in 1981 in the Roger Tory Peterson <emph render="italic">Field Guide</emph> series, an inclusion that generated media attention and notoriety. Included in this series are both handwritten and typed drafts, proofread copies, correspondence regarding drafts and the finished product, individual chapter files along with many photographs, slides and negatives. The collection also includes three folders containing files from a collaborative project Schaefer worked on titled "Glories of the Sky." </p><p> Photographs are sleeved where possible. Photocopies of the original layout of notes and labels affixed to the photographs are in the folders. While some of the photographs have information written on the back, many are blank.</p><p> The series is organized alphabetically and then chronologically where multiple entries exist. Oversized material from this series is noted in the box and folder list.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_9a0d4a08035b0895a483cf17a027da86" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appendices - Notes and drafts</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_bea16704b686b1311048339c1760e0ad" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (10-A Field Guide to the Atmosphere)</container><container id="aspace_477cdda33054256d2fec64e904ca70f6" parent="aspace_bea16704b686b1311048339c1760e0ad" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d513a853c88b13e78c09d5d920dae5ab" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appendices, Glossary and index</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1977/1977" type="inclusive">1977</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b9475e2621d034d3a59f9fc13e84fd92" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (10-A Field Guide to the Atmosphere)</container><container id="aspace_139bd29b5af679172b56f63bab1b1310" parent="aspace_b9475e2621d034d3a59f9fc13e84fd92" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_88a7f82c1d1b204426f4879e39875252" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appendices and Indices -

There are also some reels that document his consulting work as well as a few that cover personal interests such as hiking. Films vary between 16 millimeter and 35 millimeter, with an emphasis on the latter. Some footage is black and white while other footage is in color. There were some film containers that arrived at the archives with two ID numbers on them; using Schaefer's own list, the archivist made every attempt to follow the creator's original numbering system. Due to time constraints on processing as well as the delicate nature of the film reels, most of the footage has not yet been viewed by the archivist. Please also note that the film titles are taken directly from Schaefer's own labels, which is why many are abbreviated.</p><p> Researchers may access PDF files of Schaefer's original film inventory (first digital object) as well as the archives' spreadsheet version of that inventory (second digital object) by clicking on the following links: </p><p> <dao title="original film inventory" linktype="simple" href="http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/eresources/findingaids/FilmList_FromVJS_findaid.pdf" actuate="onrequest" show="new"/> <dao title="original film spreadsheet" linktype="simple" href="http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/eresources/findingaids/VJS_films_excel.pdf" actuate="onrequest" show="new"/> These links contain more detailed information about each film such as size, color vs. black and white, and added notes, if available.

This subseries contains his schedules and itineraries, along with Schaefer's personal logs from 1947 through 1993. Along with Schaefer's own autobiography Twenty Years at Langmuir University there are timelines, resumes, and lists of works published, all created by Schaefer.</p><p> When Schaefer was not conducting research experiments, he had numerous interests and hobbies that occupied much of his time such as Scouting with the Lone Scouts and as a Boy Scouts of America scoutmaster of a troop in Schenectady, NY, avid participation and avocation for conservation of the Adirondacks where he, himself owned a camp, Woestyne North. Conservation played a large portion of Dr. Schaefer's time outside of the professional avenues; he advocated for the preservation of the Adirondacks, Whiteface and Gore Mountains, the Mohawk Valley area, Vrooman's Nose in Schoharie County and was a member of the Van Epps Hartley chapter of the New York State Archeological Association. He was a founding member of the Mohawk Valley Hiking Club. Personal items and experiences related to all of these interests are found within this subseries.</p><p> This subseries also documents family relationships. There are family photographs and correspondence with his wife Lois, their three children, and his younger brother Paul. Also included are diaries of family trips, including a cross-country adventure.</p><p> In addition, many of Schaefer's colleagues wrote reminiscences about their experiences and memories; these have been collected and placed in this subseries. Among such is a tribute to Schaefer by Duncan Blanchard that appeared in the ASRC annual report in 1975-1976. As Schaefer gained international acclaim in the atmospheric world, he received many awards and honorary degrees at Notre Dame, York University and Siena College.</p><p> Late in life, Schaefer embarked on the project "Ancient Windows of the Earth" which involved cutting rocks from across the country into thin slices with a diamond saw. The slices transmitted light and also showed the color, pattern and structure of the rock. Schaefer often used the rock slices to form unique creations such as windows or lampshades. This subseries includes correspondence about the ongoing project, cutouts, samples of rock slices, the history of each original creation and the technique of the manufacturing.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_3f5bce4d1770caa0caa6b6b1c916a38e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address Book of V.J.

Although the majority of the records are from Schaefer's retirement during the late 1980s and early 1990s when he had significant time to devote to this pursuit, researching and surveying Dutch barns was a lifelong hobby. For example, there are images of barns from the 1930s and a newspaper clipping discussing a planned lecture by Schaefer on Dutch barns from January 1939. Schaefer was very active in the Dutch Barn Preservation Society and received a Preservation League of New York State Award in 1991 for restoration and protection of the Greater Wemp Barn. This multi-year effort to save and ultimately relocate the Greater Wemp Barn is well-documented in this subseries. Other materials of interest are several volumes of Dutch Barn Research Miscellany, a publication edited by Schaefer, articles on barns written by Schaefer, background information on barns in New York compiled by Schaefer, especially those in the Capital District, and numerous slides and photographs.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_49424bfee6ba52d3771af820f8d24326" level="file"><did><unittitle>"An Analysis of the Roof Line Evolution of the New World Dutch Barn"- Vincent Schaefer</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1988/1988" type="inclusive">1988</unitdate><container id="aspace_0e5cb7daeb31761b978eda8996e2a731" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">9 (12-Biographical &amp;

Schaefer was a vice president and trustee of the Schenectady County Historical Society and wrote for the organization's Milestone newsletter. He also helped found the Van Epps-Hartley chapter of the New York State Archeological Association, which was formally organized in 1931, and later served as chapter president. There is significant correspondence about the chapter's founding and several articles authored by Schaefer about archeological sites and artifacts in this subseries. There also is correspondence between Schaefer and New York State Archeologist Arthur C. Parker, then museum director at the City of Rochester, New York's Municipal Museum.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ccb7c7ff95366d835cabce2081071a8d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Adirondack History</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1989/1989" type="inclusive">1989</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1891/1993" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_71072d482a186d0fdef9388ac2f5a7be" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11 (12-Biographical &amp; Autobiographical Materi)</container><container id="aspace_d13d64692e20e5c4144f90569aa61a8f" parent="aspace_71072d482a186d0fdef9388ac2f5a7be" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_66587b22c7ff7e6e62b9f4e3a5f2fac4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany County History</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1988/1988" type="inclusive">1988</unitdate><container id="aspace_29088ac92c1bad7a329282219fc94bf5" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">11 (12-Biographical &amp; Autobiographical Materi)</container><container id="aspace_23001f11ae5429fcaf9153677599842f" parent="aspace_29088ac92c1bad7a329282219fc94bf5" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_af98490f74da6388edbdcd9246e858b5" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A Little of the Story and Interests as Told by Old Military Buttons"- Robert M.
