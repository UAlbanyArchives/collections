<p>Edward S. LeComte was born Edward S. Brandt in New York City on May 28, 1916.  As a young adult he legally changed his last name to that of his stepfather, LeComte.  He studied English at Columbia University and received his A.B. in 1939, his M.A. in 1940, and his Ph.D. in 1943.  After finishing his studies, LeComte taught English at Columbia, first as an instructor and then as a professor, from 1943 until 1964.  In 1964 he joined the English faculty at the University at Albany, where he remained until his retirement in 1981.  LeComte specialized in the works of John Milton and wrote numerous articles and books on the subject.  In addition, he wrote several works of fiction. LeComte passed away on October 23, 2004.</p>  </bioghist>
