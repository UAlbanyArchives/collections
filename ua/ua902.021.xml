    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Leonard Gregory Kastle, American composer, pianist, film writer and director, was born in New York City on February 11, 1929. Following his high school education in Mount Vernon, NY, Kastle began his musical training at the Julliard School of Music in New York City, 1938-40. From 1940-42, he attended the Mannes Music School, where he studied piano with Frank Sheridan and composition with George Szell. From 1942-52, Kastle held a piano scholarship with Paul Wittgenstein. Kastle studied composition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia from 1944-50, earning a B.A. in 1950. While at the Curtis Institute, he held scholarships in composition with Rosario Scalero, Gian-Carlo Menotti, and Samuel Barber, and a scholarship in piano with Isabelle Vengerova. In addition, Kastle attended Columbia University from 1947-50. He was a student of conducting with Carl Bamberger in NYC from 1950-52.</p><p> Kastle's early professional career was spent on Broadway where he was music directory for revivals of Menotti's <emph render="italic">The Medium</emph> (1950) and <emph render="italic">The Telephone</emph> (1950) and for Weill's <emph render="italic">Lady in the Dark</emph> (1951). He was assistant musical director and conductor for NBC television's <emph render="italic">Opera Theater</emph> from 1955-1959, directing one of his own operas, <emph render="italic">The Swing</emph> (one act, televised by NBC on June 11, 1954), as well as works of other composers. Other operas both written and directed by Kastle include <emph render="italic">Deseret</emph> (an opera in three acts based on the life of the Mormon prophet Brigham Young, televised by NBC on January 11, 1961 and revived in 1978); <emph render="italic">The Pariahs</emph>, (opera in three acts about whaling commissioned by the Deerfield Foundation; completed in 1966; with excerpts performed in Albany, NY in 1985); <emph render="italic">The Passion of Mother Ann: A Sacred Festival Play</emph> (opera trilogy about the Shakers, excerpts performed: The Calling of Mother Ann in Albany, NY in 1985, and The Journey of Mother Ann in Potsdam, NY in 1987); and his one-act children's opera, <emph render="italic">Professor Lookalike and the Children</emph> (performed in Albany, NY in 1988).</p><p> Kastle has a number of musical and orchestral compositions to his credit. Among his orchestral compositions are <emph render="italic">From a Whitman Reader</emph> (for voice and orchestra), 1954; <emph render="italic">Poontoosuc</emph> (for baritone and orchestra, performed at Tanglewood on July 4, 1976), 1974-75; and Piano Concerto (performed by the composer as a soloist in Albany, NY in 1981). Kastle's vocal works include <emph render="italic">Three Walt Whitman Songs</emph> (for chorus), 1956; <emph render="italic">Acquainted with the Night</emph> (five songs based on poems by Robert Frost), 1957; <emph render="italic">Three Songs from Moby Dick</emph> (for chorus, winner of the Baxter Prize for choral composition), 1963; and <emph render="italic">Mass</emph> (for chorus, organ, and piano, televised by PBS on December 25,1977; revised version performed in Albany, NY on May 30, 1978). Kastle has also composed chamber pieces including <emph render="italic">Piano Sonata</emph>, 1950; <emph render="italic">Violin Sonata</emph>, 1955 (revised version performed in Albany, NY on March 17, 1986); and <emph render="italic">Piano Suite</emph>, 1957. In addition to his operatic and musical compositions, Kastle wrote and directed the film, <emph render="italic">The Honeymoon Killers</emph>, which was released by Cinerama in 1970. In 1970, the film was chosen by the Museum of Modern Art for inclusion in its film archives, and in 1971 it received the Black Humor Award in Paris. <emph render="italic">The Honeymoon Killers</emph> was re-released nationally in 1992, when it was also shown at the San Francisco Film Festival, the Festivale Internationale Cinema Giovani in Italy, and the Film Forum in New York City. In 1998, the film was featured at the Midnight Sun Film Festival in Sodankylä, Finland.</p><p> Kastle received a number of prizes, grants and awards during his lifetime including first prize in the Leschetitsky Piano Competition (1948), a Baxter Prize for choral composition (1963), an NEA grant (1974), and two Meet-the-Composer grants (1981 and 1985).</p><p> From 1978 to 1989 Kastle was a visiting professor of humanities and fine arts at the University at Albany, SUNY where he taught composition. After retiring from the University, Kastle continued to teach classes as an adjunct faculty member. 
 
 He died in May 2011 at the age of 82.</p>  </bioghist>
