    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In 1983, novelist William Kennedy founded the Writers Institute at Albany with part of a fellowship awarded him from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago. As part of that award, fifteen thousand dollars for five years went to the institution of Kennedy's choice, the University at Albany, State University of New York. The University made a commitment to match those funds. Less than a year later, Governor Mario M. Cuomo signed into law the legislation creating the New York State Writers Institute, giving it goals and responsibilities to conduct a broad range of cultural and educational literary activities.</p><p>The Writers Institute has a mandate to provide "a milieu for established and aspiring writers to work together to increase the freedom of the artistic imagination," and "to encourage the development of writing skills at all levels of education throughout the state."  The Institute draws upon and complements existing programs in imaginative writing and the allied arts to help provide the broadest possible educational base for students of writing and the literary community statewide. Its programming receives strong support from the Capital area's literary community, drawing audiences from eastern and southern New England, New York City and a large part of central and eastern New York State.</p>  </bioghist>
