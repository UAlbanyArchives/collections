    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Edith Owen Wallace was a faculty member and classics professor at the New York State College for Teachers, and the State University of New York at Albany for more than forty years. Born in Albany in 1896, Wallace attended the Milne School before received her B.A. from the New York State College for Teachers at Albany from 1913 to 1917. While at the State College for Teachers, Wallace was a founding member of Myskania. She later received an M.A. from Wellesley College and a Ph.D. from Columbia University.  Wallace was hired by the college in 1918 as a Latin Instructor, a position she held until she was appointed as a professor in 1929, teaching courses in Greek, Latin and Comparative Literature. She continued to teach at the College and later University until her retirement in 1965.</p><p>During her time teaching in Albany, Wallace was a leader in the development of the College's M.A. in Latin program and the creation of the Department of Comparative Literature. She also served as Chair of the Department of Languages and Literature and as the Chair of the Division of Humanities during her time at the University. Wallace died in Albany in 1972. After Wallace's death, the Uptown campus' Humanities Building was renamed in her honor.</p>  </bioghist>
