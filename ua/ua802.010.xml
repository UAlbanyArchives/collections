    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Roger Conant, a graduate student in the Department of History, met Vasiliki "Vicki" Gekas when he arrived at the University at Albany in the 1970 winter semester. Both lived in Brubacher Hall, the graduate student dormitory on Alumni Quad. Born in Greece, Gekas emigrated to Rochester, NY as a child. She received her bachelor of arts degree from the University at Albany in 1969 and returned for graduate studies. Both she and Conant received master of arts degrees from the University in 1972.</p><p> Gekas was the inspiration for the main character in <title><emph render="italic">Las Isla de los Jacinto Cortados (The Island of the Cut Hyacinths)</emph></title> (1980) by award-winning Spanish novelist Gonzalo Torrente Ballester. Torrente Ballester joined the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University at Albany in 1966 and remained until 1972. During this period, he met Gekas and later wrote about her in the novel which is partially set on and near the University at Albany campus, features some real professors and other students (some named, some with pseudonyms) and focuses on a love triangle.</p><p> Today Conant is a historian and filmmaker specializing in the cultural heritage of East Central Europe.</p>  </bioghist>
