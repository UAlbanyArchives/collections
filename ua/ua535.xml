    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Office of Information Systems and Technology was established in 1985 as a division of Academic Affairs to coordinate information technology in both academic and administrative departments at the University. In 1987, it assumed responsibility for the University Libraries; this lasted until 1998-1999, when the Libraries split off to become a separate administrative unit within Academic Affairs. By 2003 the Office had been restructured, split off from Academic Affairs, and replaced by the Office of Information Technology Services, which is overseen by the Chief Information Officer of the University.</p>  </bioghist>
