    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This artificial collection contains University at Albany calendars used to announce both on and off-campus events to the university community at large.  The collection currently covers a period from 1989 through 1994.  While the file of calendars for the 1989-1990 academic year appears to be complete, the other years covered by this collection have significant gaps in their coverage and are largely incomplete.</p>  </scopecontent>
