<p>The organization was established in 1973 with a grant from the U.S. Department of Education TRIO Programs (Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Special Services for Disadvantaged Students). In 1974, it was officially named the Rehabilitation Service Program, and charged with the responsibility of coordinating special services for the disabled. The Program was renamed the Program for Disabled Student Services in 1981. It has since been renamed the Disability Resources Center.</p>  </bioghist>
