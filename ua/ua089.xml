    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Caucus on Women's Rights at SUNY was organized in Syracuse, New York in June 1970. The group's general intent was to seek equal rights for women on the campuses of the State University of New York system and coordinate activities among campuses. Albany was one of thirty chapters organized. The Caucus on Women's Rights at SUNY ratified goals at a meeting in September 1970 which were presented to the Chancellor in late 1970. The issues addressed by the Caucus included equal compensation and benefits, affirmative action, parental leave, health and retirement benefits, various student concerns, and parttime employment.</p>  </bioghist>
