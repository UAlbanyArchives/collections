    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Office was formed in 1971 due to the establishment of an Affirmative Action Program on campus. It was initially part of the Office of Personnel and led by Leon J. Calhoun. As the responsibilities of this office expanded it became its own entity and was known as the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity. The office expanded through Title IX and Section 504 legislation that had recently been signed into law. These included the creation of sports teams for female students and addressed the treatment of students with disabilities on campus. It later became known as the Affirmative Action Office and overseen by Gloria DeSole who also worked in the Task Force for Women's Safety at the same time. In 2003 it became known as the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action before becoming the Office of Diversity and Inclusion in 2010. 
     The role of this is to provide diversity-related training and resources, address discrimination and harassment complaints, enforcement and support of legislation such as Section 504. One of their greatest current responsibilites is oversight on the recruiting and hiring processes in all aspects of the University. This includes approval of advertisements for positions and potential candidates for interviews.</p>  </bioghist>
