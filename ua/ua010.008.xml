    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The President's Special Committee to Review the Undergraduate Experience (SCRUE) was created with the intention of reforming the university's undergraduate curriculum by defining undergraduate degrees and creating more structured programs of study.  The Committee's ultimate proposal would be based heavily upon a similar program being implemented at Middlebury College of Vermont at the same time.  Recommendations would include the reimplementation of general education requirements outside of the student's degree program and an increased emphasis on writing assignments through the university.  The committee's report was presented in 1977 May.</p>  </bioghist>
