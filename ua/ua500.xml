    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs was established in 1965 by President Evan R. Collins as a successor to the Office of the Dean, which had previously overseen academic programs. The Provost manages all aspects of the University's academic mission. This includes oversight of all of the undergraduate and graduate programs, enrollment, and advisement. The Provost is also responsible for overseeing the registration process for new academic programs as well as the periodic review, conducted by the State Education Department and by outside accrediting bodies, of existing programs. As of 2016, the office is referred to as the Office of the Provost, while the Provost's title remains Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost.</p>  </bioghist>

This includes correspondence with the State Education Department, documentation of State Education Department regulations, reports and reviews of academic programs conducted internally and by external reviewers, letters of intent for the establishment of new programs (including letters of intent received from other universities and colleges), and other supporting correspondence and documentation. Some of the graduate program review materials were originally created by the Office of Graduate Studies, but were transferred to this collection to keep all program review material together and better
