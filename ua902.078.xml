While Fausold subsequently asked individuals interviewed for the Oral History of SUNY Project to sign a clearance form, not all interview files donated to the archive contain forms.

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Born in Pennsylvania in 1921, Dr. Martin L. Fausold was a Distinguished Professor of History (later Emeritus) at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Geneseo, an eminent scholar of Herbert C. Hoover and author of five books and numerous
                articles during his lifetime. Matin Fausold received his bachelor's degree in History from Gettysburg College, served in World War II, and completed his doctoral degree in 1953 from Syracuse University, in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.</p>
      <p>Dr. Fausold was a professor at SUNY Buffalo and SUNY Cortland, and then joined the faculty at
                SUNY Geneseo in 1958 as chair of the Division of Social Science. Dr. Fausold also was Vice
                President and later President of the Faculty Association of the State University of
                New York (currently the SUNY Faculty Senate). SUNY honored him with the rank of Distinguished Service Professor in 1985.  He retired from teaching in 1992.</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1988, Dr. Fausold began a 20-year effort to create an
                oral history of the SUNY System that was still ongoing at the time of his death. This project involved significant research and interviewing of key SUNY administrators, board members and faculty and New York State budget directors, and comprises the majority of this collection. Based upon his interests, Dr. Fausold helped develop and coordinate the first SUNY history conference in 1991, held at SUNY Brockport, and was actively engaged in planning for a conference honoring the 60th anniversary of SUNY, which was subsequently held in late 2008.</p>
      <p>Dr. Fausold passed away in October 2008, preceded in death by his wife Daryl Clement Fausold.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Martin Fausold Papers document his work with the State University of New York System, including his 20-year long Oral History of SUNY Project, which attempted to record the history of the SUNY System through interviews with key administrators, historians and faculty, and his involvement with the Faculty Association of the State University of
                New York.  This collection is divided into four series arranged alphabetically: The Oral
                History of SUNY Project, Research and Subject Files, Faculty Association of the State University of
                New York (FASUNY), and the 1991 Brockport
                Conference.</p>
      <p>The Oral History of SUNY Project series contains audio cassette tapes, transcripts, notes and related correspondence of the
                interviews conducted by Fausold and his colleagues. His research materials for the
                Oral History of SUNY Project as well as other subject files are housed in the Research and
                Subject Files. Fausold’s FASUNY records, which include newsletters, meeting
                minutes, correspondence, and reports are retained in their own respective series.
                Lastly, the 1991 Brockport Conference, the first conference devoted to the history of the SUNY System, is separated into its own series. It includes
                the Conference’s program, lists of participants, and the papers presented.</p>
      <p>Researchers should note that many materials from the Oral History of SUNY Project related to SUNY Geneseo are housed at SUNY Geneseo, where Fausold served as a Distinguished Professor of History.  
                In addition, as the Fausold Papers at the University at Albany contain only a limited number of personal papers, researchers should instead contact SUNY Geneseo or Indiana University of
                Pennsylvania, which holds the broader Fausold Family Papers, for more information.</p>
      <p>Please also note that the family of
                Samuel Gould, chancellor of SUNY from 1964-1970 and interviewed for Fausold's Oral History of SUNY Project in 1989, later gave Fausold materials created and amassed by the former chancellor. Since the materials
                were more of a personal nature and are not directly related to the Oral History
               of SUNY Project, archivists are adding them to the Samuel Gould Papers (APAP-058) already housed
                in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives.</p>
      <p>Researchers may consult other SUNY and educational collections and records held in the M. E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, which, in addition to the the papers of Chancellor Gould, includes the papers of Assistant to the Chancellor John Mather, SUNY Trustee Chairmen or chairs Frank Moore and Donald Blinken, as well as many other retained records relating to SUNY Central.</p>

          <p>The first series in the Fausold Collection consists of interviews conducted by
                        Fausold for the Oral History of SUNY project from 1988 to 1997. Fausold’s colleague Wayne
                        Mahood, a Distinguished Professor of Education at SUNY Geneseo, helped conduct some of the interviews as did others. The archivist noted interviews not conducted by Fausold in the inventory below as well as the titles held by the interviewees in the SUNY System or within New York State government. This
                        series includes both the recorded interviews on audio cassettes as well as paper transcripts.
                        A small number of interviews, however, are not transcribed. A majority of the
                        interviews transcribed feature multiple versions, as both
                        Fausold and the interviewee edited them. Interview files typically contain
                        interview transcriptions, a clearance form signed by the interviewee, and
                        background information. Fausold kept lists of interviewees, potential
                        interviewees, and the status of each interview.</p>

          <p>The second series of this collection consists of Fausold’s research and
                        subject files. A majority of this series are research materials for the Oral
                        History of SUNY Project. These materials include a large number of
                        dissertations, newspaper articles, and multiple finding aides to archival collections, some annotated by Fausold. There are
                        also multiple copies of Fausold’s <emph render="italic">Draft History of the State University of
                        New York</emph> as well as executive committee meeting minutes and membership
                        lists. Fausold’s applications and acceptance letters into the Research
                        Foundation and Visiting Professorships' GRI Program can be found in this
                        series. Fausold also kept records of Research Foundation expenses,
                        correspondence, and funding possibilities. This series also contains
                        Fausold’s correspondence from the 1980s to the 2000s about the Oral
                        History of SUNY Project.</p>

          <p>Series 3 consists of Fausold’s records during his time as Vice President and
                        President of the Faculty Association of the State University of New York
                        (FASUNY). FASUNY’s purpose was to promote unity within the SUNY System
                        faculty. The organization was concerned with not only improving the general
                        welfare of SUNY faculty, but with improving education opportunities in
                        the State of New York as well. FASUNY informed members of its efforts
                        through its newsletter. This series contains copies of the Association’s
                        newsletters from 1957-1968 as well as mailing lists. FASUNY hosted a
                        biennial conference where members of the Association met to discuss problems
                        of public higher education and conduct Association related business. This series also includes FASUNY meeting
                        minutes, membership information and Fausold's 1960s professional correspondence. Fausold
                        also kept records of the SUNY budget, payroll, and salary reports.</p>
          <p>It
                        should be noted that there are three folders within this series that are
                        labeled as a “Chronological File.” While not descriptive, this was Fausold's original title and the archivist 
                        preserved it.</p>

          <p>The fourth series of the collection contains papers from <emph render="italic">The Coming of SUNY
                        Conference</emph> hosted at SUNY Brockport in 1991. This conference is particularly
                        important as it was one of the first efforts to gather historians and
                        archivists to discuss the founding and history of the SUNY System. The
                        conference program as well as a list of participants is included in this
                        series. Papers and abstracts listed in the program are also included in this
                        series as well as some of Fausold’s personal notes on each.</p>
