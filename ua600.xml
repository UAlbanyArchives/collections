      <p>The University at Albany's created the School of Arts and Sciences in 1963 to bring together all the programs in the arts and sciences, in 1964 its name was changed to the College of Arts and Sciences.  The College was divided into the Divisions of Humanities, Science and Mathematics, and the Social Sciences.  The College of Arts and Sciences was dissolved in 1978-79 into the new Colleges of Humanities and Fine Arts, Science and Mathematics, and Social and Behavioral Sciences. The College of Arts and Sciences was officially recreated in October of 1993 after the recommendations made by a Task Force on Campus Organization were accepted by then President H. Patrick Swygert. The Colleges of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Science and Mathematics, and Humanities and Fine Arts, were officially brought together to form the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
