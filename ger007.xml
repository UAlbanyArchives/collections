      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Fritz W. Neugass (pseudonyms François Neuville and Friedrich Brenatano) was born on
                the 28th of March 1899 in Mannheim, Baden, Germany to a Protestant-Jewish family. In
                1917, he finished school in Mannheim with an end examination (an "Arbitur"), which
                granted him permission to study at a university. During this time, Neugass was
                briefly a member of the Wandervogel movement. The following year, Neugass
                volunteered to serve in the Army. His military career was quickly ended when he was
                buried in rubble after an engagement with the enemy. Neugass spent the rest of the
                war in an army hospital, and then as a censor for the post office.</p>
      <p>From 1919 to 1924, Neugass was a student of Art and Archeology in Heidelberg
                (1919-1920), Munich (1920), Berlin (1920-1921), and Bonn (1922-1923). He received
                his Ph.D. in Heidelberg in 1924. Neugass' dissertation discussed Gothic pews, and
                was printed in Strassburg within a series of art historical studies. Shortly
                thereafter, Neugass found employment as a lab assistant at the German Archeological
                Institute in Rome, and at the German Institute for history in Florence. During this
                time, he participated in many archeological excavations in Italy.</p>
      <p>Neugass spent the years 1926 to 1939 as a resident of Paris, where he worked as an
                art correspondent for German and Swiss newspapers and art magazines, such as <emph render="italic">Berliner Tageblatt</emph>, <emph render="italic">Vossische
                    Zeitung</emph>, <emph render="italic">Weltkunst</emph>, and others. After 1933,
                his work was no longer accepted in Germany. This led Neugass to work for various
                American, British, and French periodicals. He often used the pseudonyms François
                Neuville and Friedrich Brenatano at this time. Much of Neugass' time was spent in
                the nations around the Mediterranean, where he took a large number of
                photographs.</p>
      <p>In 1939, French authorities labeled Neugass an "enemy alien" and interned him in
                Antibes and in Les Milles. Neugass later wrote a novel about his experiences in the
                French detention camps. In 1940, he arrived in Free France (Cannes), and applied
                unsuccessfully for an American visa through the Emergency Rescue Commission of
                Varian Fry. Nevertheless, Neugass managed to emigrate to the United states via
                Casablanca in December 1941 just before a Vichy court found Neugass guilty of "enemy
                propaganda".</p>
      <p>Shortly after his arrival in the U.S., Neugass worked as a swimming instructor and as
                a nurse. He made various unsuccessful applications to join the U.S. Army or to work
                in the war industry. While taking night-classes to learn blueprint drawing, Neugass
                performed volunteer work for the Red Cross of New York City. Not long before the end
                of the War, Neugass joined the NYC Patrol Corps. He also worked with the Volunteer
                Service Photographers (who aided paraplegic G.I.'s with photography).</p>
      <p>In 1944, Neugass married Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin. Labus
                and Neugass had met in the U.S. When the War ended, Neugass became a free-lance
                photographer. He published photos and articles in American and European photo
                magazines, such as <emph render="italic">Aufbau</emph>, <emph render="italic">New
                    Yorker</emph>, <emph render="italic">New Yorker Staats- Zeitung und
                    Herold</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Art News</emph>. He became a member of
                the American Society of Magazine Photographers, and had an exhibition of his work at
                the Village Camera Club. In 1954, the American Museum of Natural History held an
                exhibit of several dozen photographs that Neugass had taken in Mexico the previous
                year.</p>
      <p>After 1947, Neugass re-established contact with various German newspapers and
                magazines, and became a correspondent on the subjects of art, architecture, the art
                market, and photography. He later became a permanent contributor to the <emph render="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</emph>, <emph render="italic">Handelsblatt</emph>, and other European art and photography magazines. Neugass
                often wrote for the American art magazine <emph render="italic">Art
                Voices</emph>.</p>
      <p>In January 1979, Neugass was forced to turn down an offer to act as the American
                editor for a new German magazine (<emph render="italic">Art</emph>) due to poor
                health. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the
                15th of October 1979 at the Goethe House of New York City.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Fritz Neugass was a professional photographer and journalist as early as 1926, when
                he first moved to Paris. He was active almost until the day of his death in 1979.
                The earliest photographs in the collection (not including his personal family
                pictures) date from the 1930s (few of these images have specific dates written on
                them.) The dates for the entire collection of papers and photographs range from 1913
                to 1979. There are many gaps in time for this collection, which is to be expected in
                a set of personal papers.</p>
      <p>The basic arrangement of the Neugass Papers was completed by Lotte Neugass prior to
                their deposit at the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. The
                collection was divided two main sections. Section one contains mostly typewritten
                notes (in German and in English), photographs, books, and clippings from
                periodicals. This material relates to various museum art exhibits and art auctions
                that took place from the early 1950s to the 1970s. Other papers discuss the work of
                well-known artists and styles of art, as well as contemporary news events. Much, if
                not most, of the above material apparently served as sources for articles that were
                written by Neugass. The second section, almost exclusively photographs, includes
                personal family pictures, views in and around New York City, images from his travels
                overseas (and his days as a photojournalist in the 1930s), studies of patterns and
                faces, prints by other photographers, and mounted images for his exhibits of images
                from NYC and Mexico. As few of these prints have any dates, they have been organized
                largely by subject. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in
                the collection.</p>
      <p>The Neugass Papers have been divided into sixteen series. The first nine series
                (corresponding to section one of the Lotte Neugass arrangement) consist of
                typewritten texts by Neugass in English and German, photographs (not taken by
                Neugass) used by Neugass to accompany his articles, and clippings used by Neugass in
                his writing. The series are arranged by subject: Series 1: Art and Artists; Series
                2: Museums &amp; Private Collections; Series 3: Art market, art auctions; Series
                4: Architecture &amp; Architects; Series 5: Furniture and Design; Series 6:
                Theater and Film; Series 7: Photography and Photographers; Series 8: General
                journalistic articles; and Series 9: Articles with text and photos by Neugass. The
                remaining series include: Series 10: Published writings by Neugass, 1942-1979;
                Series 11: Early writings (pre-US) of Fritz Neugass, 1930s-1940; Series 12:
                Documents and biographical materials, 1899-1979; Series 13: Correspondence,
                1941-1979; Series 14: Photographs by Fritz Neugass, 1930s-1970s; Series 15:
                Photographs by other artists; Series 16: Sotheby Parke-Bernet auction catalogs,
                1931-1979.</p>

          <p>This series contains approximately 4500 original photographs and contact
                        prints by Fritz Neugass. They are divided into two series: locations and
                        subjects. Photographs include travel photographs of Greece and other
                        Mediterranean countries, Cape Cod and Provincetown of the 1940s and 1950s,
                        Mexico and the U.S. Southwest, and especially New York City. In addition, a
                        number of the photographs have been reproduced and mounted, or have been
                        reproduced in enlarged formats. This series also contains mounted
                        photographs from two exhibits by Neugass: a Hypo-Hounds exhibit at the Users
                        Club, NY, in the 1940s; and a Mexico Exhibit, shown at the American Museum
                        of Natural History, NY, March 4-28, 1954.</p>

          <p>This series contains Sotheby Parke-Bernet auction catalogs dating from
                        1938-1979. A complete list of the catalogs is located in Box 62. The
                        catalogs have been listed by date, sale catalog number, with brief
                        description. Neugass attended most of the auctions represented by the
                        catalogs, and each catalog is accompanied by price lists resulting from the
                        auctions. The catalogs are also annotated by Neugass. Neugass wrote articles
                        on many of the auctions he attended, the texts of which are contained in
                        Series 3.</p>
