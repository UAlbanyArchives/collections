      <p>With the exception of the 1970s scrapbooks, the collection was donated in 2010 by John
        Schneider, Class of 1965.</p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>In 1913, fifteen female students at what was then the New York State Normal College (now
        the University at Albany) formed a club they called Theta Rho. The students, who roomed
        together at 186 Western Avenue in Albany, drafted a constitution and held regular meetings.
        New members were brought into the club each year.</p>
      <p>In the 1917-1918 school year, the organization re-wrote its constitution and renamed itself
        Gamma Kappa Phi. Members rented their own house at 36 Nineteenth Street (currently Winthrop
        Avenue) and held a formal initiation for the first time. In 1919 Gamma Kappa Phi petitioned
        to become an official sorority of the New York State College for Teachers (the school's name
        in that time period). The petition was granted in April 1920, and Gamma Kappa Phi was
        admitted to the Intersorority Council.</p>
      <p>Over the ensuing decades, the sorority lived at a number of locations in downtown Albany
        until, in the 1960s, its members along with the other Greek organizations at the University
        were moved into the dormitories on the Uptown Campus. Gamma Kappa Phi is no longer an active
        sorority at the University at Albany. The organization closed in the 1970s, like many other
        local sororities, because of dwindling membership.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection consists of seven bound volumes. The first five are administrative records
        while the latter two are scrapbooks.</p>
      <p>The administrative books include the recording secretary's book, which has a history of
        Gamma Kappa Phi from its formation until 1951, and meeting minutes from 1920-1939. There is
        another record book with meeting minutes and attendance lists, dating from 1963-1967. Two
        alumnae books include lists of Gamma Kappa Phi alumnae and records of payment of alumnae
        dues; they are dated 1920-1946 and 1956-1957. Finally there is a treasury record book, which
        includes a ledger of sorority funds, budgets, and some receipts, from 1948-1955.</p>
      <p>The scrapbooks date to 1970-1971 and have pictures of the sorority's activities from that
        year.</p>
