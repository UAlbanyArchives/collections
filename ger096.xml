      <p>The Alfred Werner Papers were donated to the University Libraries of the State University
        of New York by his widow, Lisa Werner, on November 2, 1981.</p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Alfred Werner was born Alfred Weintraub on March 30, 1911. Both his mother, Frederika (née
        Silberstein) and father, Ignatz Weintraub, were born in the former Polish city of Lwow
        (Lemberg), but relocated to Vienna in 1898, where Ignatz studied law at the University of
        Vienna, and where both Alfred and his brother Edward (1914) were born. Both sons followed
        their father in the study of law, although Alfred was encouraged early by his teachers to
        study philology.</p>
      <p>Werner studied law at the University of Vienna from 1929 to 1934, but also took courses in
        German literature, philology, pedagogy, history and geography, with aspirations of a
        teaching career. After his graduation from the University, he continued his literary
        pursuits, writing for the Jewish publication <emph render="italic">Die Stimme</emph> and
          <emph render="italic">Gerechtigkeit</emph> and publishing a volume of his poetry under the
        title <emph render="italic">Gebet aus der Tiefe</emph> in 1936. During this time, he also
        lectured at the extension division of the University of Vienna and acted as literary
        director of the Jüdische Kulturstelle in Vienna. His career was cut short when he was
        arrested in 1938 and sent to the concentration camp Dachau, where he spent nearly a year,
        until he was allowed to immigrate to England in 1939. During the summer of 1940, Werner was
        again briefly interned, this time in the Kitchener Camp near Sandwich, England, awaiting a
        U.S. visa. Werner wrote articles for the camp publication, <emph render="italic">The
          Kitchener Review</emph>, and continued to write poetry describing his experiences of exile
        and internment.</p>
      <p>In 1940, Werner arrived in New York City, spent a year mastering his English language
        skills, and by 1941 was free-lance writing articles and reviews for the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">Kenyon Review</emph>, <emph render="italic">Commentary</emph> and <emph render="italic">Arts Magazine</emph>. He
        became an editor for the <emph render="italic">Universal Jewish Encyclopedia</emph> in 1941
        and continued until 1945. During the late 1940s, Werner continued to pursue his free-lance
        career and also held editorial positions on the <emph render="italic">Chicago Jewish
          Forum</emph> and later <emph render="italic">Survey Reports</emph>.</p>
      <p>Werner spent the years from 1949 to 1952 absorbed in the study of art history at the
        Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, the beginning of his career as an art
        historian and serious art critic. From 1953 until his death in 1979, Werner published no
        less than 20 monographs on such artists as Ernst Barlach, Marc Chagall, Edgar Degas, Amedeo
        Modigliani, Chaim Soutine, Moses Soyer and Max Weber, as well as over 2000 articles and
        reviews on artists and art topics, including his regular monthly article series, “Views and
        Visions”, for the magazine <emph render="italic">Art Voices</emph>.</p>
      <p>Werner was married three times, but had no children. His first wife, Gertrude "Trudy", a
        psychoanalyst, emigrated with Werner to the United States in 1940, but died shortly thereafter.
        Werner married his second wife, Judith, in 1953, who died in the late 1960s. He was married
        to his third wife, Lisa, from 1975 until his death on July 14, 1979.</p>

          <p>One folder of correspondence contains primarily letters to libraries and publishers, in
            request of information on Werner’s research interests. The second folder contains
            Undated “letters to the editor” written by Werner. There are also small amounts of
            correspondence scattered throughout the collection and filed under the subject of the
            correspondence. As can be noted, Werner often re-used the backs of letters received to
            take notes on various topics.</p>

          <p>This series contains Werner’s early belletristic writings, primarily poetry. Many of
            the English poems, as well as the prose writings, written between 1939 and 1940,
            describe the experiences of exile, internment in a British labor camp, as well as
            Werner’s voyage and early days in the United States.</p>

            of correspondence, clippings, exhibition catalogs, and photographs pertaining to
            lexicon, magazine and newspaper articles and book reviews written by Alfred Werner on
            artists and other personalities. Although most of the typescripts of the articles are
            Undated, they range from the early 1940s until Werner’s death in 1979.</p>

          <p>TThis series contains typescripts, proofs, handwritten and typed notes, a small amount
            of correspondence, clippings, exhibition catalogs, and photographs pertaining to
            magazine and newspaper articles and book reviews written by Alfred Werner on various art
            topics, with an emphasis on Jewish themes. Although most of the typescripts of the
            articles are Undated, they range from the early 1940s until Werner’s death in 1979.</p>
