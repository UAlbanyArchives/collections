      <head>Acquisition Information</head>
      <p>All items in this manuscript group were donated to the University Libraries,
	  M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, by Jackelyn Freedman,
	  Executive Director of the Conference of Large City Boards of Education in October 1989. </p>

      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p> The Special Task Force on Equity and Excellence in Education was appointed as part of the
	  Conference of Large City Boards of Education of New York State in 1978. Governor Hugh Carey
	  appointed the Task Force to investigate school finance reform after the New York State Supreme
	  Court ruled that the system of state school financing at the time was unconstitutional in the
	  Levittown vs. Nyquist case. </p>
      <p> Eugene Samter was the Executive Director of the Conference of Large City Boards of Education
	  when the Task Force was appointed, compiling data, and publishing research in several reports. The
	  materials in the collection are the files retained by Samter. The Conference of Large City Boards
	  of Education is now known as the Conference of Big Five School Districts. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The materials in the Conference of Large City Boards of Education collection are from the files
	  of the Special Task Force on Equity and Excellence in Education kept by Eugene Samter, the Executive
	  Director of the Conference. The collection includes correspondence, research materials and data,
	  meeting information, and some interim reports and drafts of reports of the Special Task Force. Some
	  reports and data are included with the correspondence. Topics covered include school vouchers, regionalism
	  in education, the correlation between class size and student achievement, special needs students, and
	  other issues related to education policy. Also included is Samter's testimony from the 1976 Levittown
	  vs. Nyquist case argued before the New York State Supreme Court. The School Finance Reform folders include
	  news clippings and research materials from school finance reform movements in New York, New Jersey, Ohio,
	  and California, including the landmark Serrano vs. Priest case from California challenging how schools
	  in the state were financed.</p>
      <p>The collection is particularly strong in documenting research materials, but it does not cover the administration
	  operation, and final report of the Special Task Force on Equity and Excellence in Education closely.</p>
