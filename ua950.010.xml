      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Alumni Quarterly was a publication originally written for and by Alumni of the New York State College for Teachers. It was first published in July 1919. Each issue would discus updates related to the campus, including various campus news, such as sporting events, club news, and appointment of new faculty. Typically in each issue there would have also been a section where alumni would write in giving them personal updates, usually related to marriages, births, relocations, and deaths. This created a cohesive community for the Alumni of the school, at a time when it was relatively small, eventually being ended because of the rapid growth of the campus population. </p>
      <p>The overall structure of the Quarterly was maintained like this throughout its history until it ceased publication in the Spring of 1967. The Alumni Association were the sole publishers of the Alumni Quarterly as well, even as the school became the State University of New York at Albany. Publication eventually ceased due to the growth in population of the school, and the decrease in dues paying members of the Alumni Association. The final issue states that in order to reach as many people as possible, the Quarterly would cease publication and be substituted by a four page newsletter to continue information alumni of events on campus.</p>
