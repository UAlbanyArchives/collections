      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>The University at Albany established the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) on February 16, 1961 , as a SUNY system-wide resource for developing and administering programs in basic and applied sciences related to the atmospheric environment. Founded by Vincent Schaefer, a General Electric protge of Nobel Prize winner Irving Langmuir, ASRCs world-class researchers study the physical and chemical nature of the atmosphere and apply that knowledge to explore the interaction of chemical, physical, geological and biological processes that impact our environment. Through technology transfer and collaboration with state, federal and industrial partners, ASRC enhances New York States scientific capacity and infrastructure, while advancing the quality of life and economic well-being of its citizens. ASRC is currently located in the CESTM (Center for Emerging Sciences &amp; Technology Management) of the SUNY Albany campus. Research and development at ASRC spans a broad spectrum of scientific areas, including: advanced sensor development; laboratory and field experiments in atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric physics, and aerosol microphysics; remote sensing of the environment; global aerosol forecasting, air quality, climate change, and dispersion modeling; and high performance computing, scientific computing, and visual analytics.</p>
