      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>The United Steelworkers of America (USWA) AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 8652 was chartered 
in 1977, and was apparently the first union since the nineteenth century to 
represent steelworkers at the Portec Corporation, Railway Products Division, 
in the Rolling Mill in Troy, New York.  The Rail Joint Company operated the 
plant before being purchased by Poor and Company, which was owned by former 
Rail Joint Company employee, Fred Poor, in 1929. The Troy plant was a rail 
joint manufacturing facility.  In 1989, Portec Rail Products, Inc. closed its 
Troy plant and moved operations to West Virginia, thereby ending Local 8652's 
brief history. Additional information about Portec Corporation is available through its 
Web site at: http://www.portecrail.com. 
Accessed 7 January 2003.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection includes contracts from 1977 through 1989, meeting minutes 
from 1982, job descriptions for employees from 1980, scattered correspondence, 
and other materials related to union business.  The closing of Portec Corporation's 
Troy facility is documented through the support services offered for employees 
by the union, a seniority list, and the shutdown agreement.  The scrapbook 
includes photocopies of news clippings and photographs documenting union members 
on strike from 1986-1987 and the closing of the Portec plant in Troy.</p>
      <p>The Rensselaer County Historical Society has records from Portec Corporation's predecessor in Troy, New York the Rail Joint Company.</p>
