      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Adelphoi Literary Society was one of the fraternal organizations for students attending the New York State Normal College High School / Milne High School, the practice teaching school for the New York State Normal College / New York State College for Teachers. The Adelphoi Literary Society was founded between 1890 and 1895.[1] The society participated in a number of academic, as well as social activities. The society held literary readings at most meetings.[3] One Adelphoian policy was to train its members in public speaking.[4] The group held many mock trials and debates. The debates usually followed political topics of the day such as, "women's suffrage"[5] or historically political topics such as, "who was the greater man Washington or Lincoln."[6] The society also organized many social outings each semester, like in 1907 a yachting party on the Hudson,[7] in 1913 sleigh rides at the Canton Hotel[8], and in 1915 they held their annual picnic at Indian Ladder.[9] The Adelphoi Literary Society appears to have remained in existence until 1960. In the December 21, 1960 edition of the Crimson and White, the Milne High newspaper, Gay Dexter reported that Dr. Carlton Moose, the faculty advisor, recommended that the Adelphoi Literary Society be discontinued for lack of interest. Dr. Moose commented that the society had only six members at this point and had "lost sight of their original function as a literary society."[10] During the years from the founding in the 1890s to its discontinuation in 1960 the society provided an academic and social outlet for many of Milne's male students. Additional information about the Adelphoi Literary Society can be found in The Crimson and White, the Milne High School literary magazine; Crimson and White, the Milne High School's newspaper; and Bricks and Ivy, the Milne High School yearbook. </p>

A review of available sources was unable to reveal the exact year the society was founded. The June 1913 issue of The Crimson and White (literary magazine) on page 139 has an ambiguous reference to the organization entering its 62nd year.

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Adelphoi Literary Society records consist of two secretary's meeting minutes books spanning the years 1902-1913, 1924-1931. No constitution or by-laws for the organization were found. The minutes contain attendance rolls and routine proceedings of the meetings as handwritten by the secretary. The secretaries recorded information about the installation of officers, literary programs, critics reports, reports of committees, and new and unfinished business. The literary programs included readings, recitations, debates, and mock trials. Each meeting appears to either begin or end with a prayer. </p>
