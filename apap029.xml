      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The New York State Chapter of the National Organization for Women, the first state chapter to be chartered in the United States, was founded on February 6, 1967. The New York State Chapter has the same purpose as the National Organization: to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society in order to exercise all privileges and responsibilities in an equal partnership with men. This purpose includes equal rights and responsibilities in all aspects of citizenship, public service, employment, education, and family life, as well as freedom from discrimination because of age, marital status, sexual preference, and parenthood [NOW-NYS Chapter By-laws, 1976, folder Bylaws, 1976-77, President's Subject Files].</p>
      <p>In 1974 NOW-New York State adopted by-laws defining the constituent element of its structure which consisted of members, member chapters, State Council, State Executive Committee, State Council Committees, State Task Forces, and the State Convention. The New York Chapter is overseen by the Executive Committee, made up of bi-annually elected officers who are composed of the President, Executive Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and three members whose portfolio was to be determined [NOW-NYS Bylaws (adopted November, 1974), folder State Council, 1973-74, State Council Meetings series]. The revised 1976 by-laws defined the responsibilities of the three additional Executive Committee members and created two new positions: Vice-President of Membership, Vice-President for Legislation, Financial Vice-President, Vice-President of Public Information, and the Chairperson of the State Council. The Executive Committee forms the decision-making body at State Council meetings. The State Council is made up of two delegates from each local Chapter of the New York State Chapter, the Executive Committee Officers, and State Task Force heads. The State Council meets at least three times a year in Albany. The Albany Area Chapter was formed in January 1972, and subsequently became the central office for New York State.</p>
      <p>The Chairperson of the State Council presides over the Council meetings, while the president presides at all State Executive Committee meetings and at the State Convention.</p>
      <p>The State Convention is the general membership assembly of New York, responsible for formulation of general policy and program priorities. State Task Forces are approved and appointed by the Executive Committee. [NOW-NYS Chapter By-laws, 1976].</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of NOW-New York State, founded in February, 1967, span the years 1966-88 with the bulk of information dating from 1974. Found in the records are minutes of meetings, correspondence, amicus briefs, programs, cassettes, and feminist literature arranged in the following record series: State Council Meetings (1974-88), President's Subject Files (1968-88), Issues Files (1966-85), Lobbyists' Files (1976-88), Mailing Lists (1982-84), Chapter Newsletters (1982-84), and a Feminist Publications Collection (1966-85). Conspicuously absent from the records are files from the early years of the organization; also there are no State Council chairs' files or Executive Committee records. NOW-NYS has concentrated on educational and political activities both for and on behalf of women and women's rights.</p>
      <p>The activities of the New York Chapter include, but are not limited to, such areas as lobbying at the State Capitol; monitoring the State Education Department to insure compliance with Title IX which forbids sex discrimination in schools; working in the area of domestic violence and battered women; monitoring the Division of Human Rights to determine whether women are fairly represented in employment discrimination complaints; working to preserve historic sites which have significance to women; helping women enter the work force for the first time; and lobbying for lesbian and reproductive rights.</p>
      <p>NOW-NYS consistently shows a concern for women and for education, a term which can refer to grade levels from kindergarten through college; to concerns within the educational system such as equality, sexism, discrimination in textbooks (1970-75); to programs such as Project Move or Project Voice (1981) or the displaced homemakers' programs of the later 1980s. It appears that the educational focus expanded from white collar to blue collar issues in the 1980s. The organization has a two-pronged education plan: to inform its members, and other women and men, about women's issues and rights through both educational and political avenues; and to prepare women to exercise those rights through job training programs and the like.</p>
      <p>The organization has a Vice-President for Legislation who is involved in lobbying efforts in Albany. Legislative issues of concern to the organization are clearly identified. The topics become more specific and focused as the organization matures. For example, marriage and divorce issues of the early 1980s become more specifically identified as issues such as orders of protection and imposed joint custody and surrogate parenting in the later 1980s. Concerns expand from equal employment (1972-75) to pay equity (1984-88). The Equal Rights Amendment (1972-88, with gaps) was regularly addressed.</p>
      <p>Some issues have been on-going concerns. Women's rights in the areas of health care and of marriage, divorce, child custody, reproduction, and domestic relations head the list of family oriented matters. In the area of employment, the organization has pursued job discrimination, sex discrimination, and pay inequalities. In various years NOW-NYS has tackled social issues including women against women (1971-74); toys and toymakers 1971-74); television portrayals of women (1973-74); prostitution (1975-76) lesbian and gay rights (1978-83); pornography, sexual assault and battering (1983-88); homelessness by divorce (1984-85).</p>

          <p>The NOW-NYS Feminist Publications Collection series contains periodicals and journals issued by a wide range of women's and feminist groups. Feminist publications include Speak Out (1972-1977), Off Our Backs (1971-1979), the Spokeswoman (1970-1977), Hera (1975), and Majority Report (1972-1979), dealing with gay and lesbian rights, reproductive rights, abortion, rape and radical political ideology. The series also includes periodicals dealing with reproductive health care and civil rights such as Family Planning/Population Reporter (1975-1977), Response to Violence in the Family (1979-1981), and Perspectives (1980-1981), a civil rights quarterly. Some periodical runs are incomplete and there are two folders of miscellaneous single issue publications. It is doubtful that NOW-NYS had a formal feminist publications collection; however, such a large quantity of feminist publications were found among the boxes processed that it was decided to organize these publications into a separate series.</p>
