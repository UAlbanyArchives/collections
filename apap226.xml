      <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
      <p>William Stiles Bennet was a U.S. Representative from New York. He was the father of
				Augustus Witschief Bennet, who also served as a U.S. Representative.</p>
      <p>Bennet was born in Port Jervis, NY on November 9, 1870. He attended the common
				schools, graduated from Port Jervis Academy in 1889, and received his law degree
				from Albany Law School in 1892.</p>
      <p>Bennet was a lawyer in private practice, an official reporter of the Orange County
				Board of Supervisors (1892-1893), a member of the New York State Assembly
				(1901-1902), a Justice of the Municipal Court of New York City (1903), a member of
				the United States Immigration Commission (1907-1910), and a delegate to the
				Republican National Convention in 1908 and 1916. He served as a Republican in the
				59th through 61st Congresses (March 4, 1905-March 3, 1911) and was an unsuccessful
				candidate for reelection in 1910. He was elected to the 64th Congress to fill the
				vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Representative Joseph A. Goulden (November 2,
				1915-March 3, 1917), but was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the 65th
				Congress in 1916. Bennet served as the official parliamentarian of the Republican
				National Convention at Chicago in 1916 and was a United States delegate to the
				Seventeenth International Congress Against Alcoholism held in Copenhagen in
				1923.</p>
      <p>From 1920 to 1933 Bennet served as General Counsel to the Edward Hines Lumber
				Company. During the later 1930s and 1940s he served as a lobbyist and advocate for
				the lumber industry. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the 75th
				Congress in 1936. That same year Bennet also unsuccessfully sought the Republican
				nomination for Vice President. He received the nomination in the Oregon primary due
				to his connection with the lumber industry in that state, but by the time of the
				national Republican Convention he was no longer considered a viable candidate and
				lost the nomination to Frank Knox of Illinois. He served as a delegate to the New
				York State Constitutional Convention in 1938. He ran unsuccessfully in a special
				election in 1944 to fill a vacancy in the 78th Congress.</p>
      <p>Bennet died on December 1, 1962, in Central Valley, NY. His ashes are interred in
				Laurel Grove Cemetery in Port Jervis, NY. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The William Stiles Bennet Papers document the personal and professional activities of
				William Stiles Bennet. They date primarily from the years 1930-1960.</p>
      <p>Series 1, Subject File, is organized alphabetically by subject. It contains Bennet's
				extensive files on various personal and professional subjects and dates primarily
				from the 1930s through the 1950s. This series include extensive files on the
				Forest-Algoma and Weyerhaeuser lumber companies, files on numerous individuals whom
				Bennet represented as an immigration lawyer, and material on the 1938 New York State
				Constitutional Convention. It also includes material related to philanthropic
				organizations such as the National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor and the
				National Bible Society.</p>
      <p>, Incoming Correspondence, contains correspondence received by William Stiles
				Bennet. Outside of a few brief items from the 1890s, material in this series dates
				from the years 1930 through 1959. These items are arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>Series 3, Outgoing Correspondence, contains outgoing correspondence sent by William
				Stiles Bennet. These materials date from the 1930s through the 1950s and are
				arranged alphabetically by correspondent.</p>
      <p>Series 4, Political Materials and Oversized Items, contains materials related to
				Bennet's various political campaigns as well as several oversized and fragile items.
				It includes a folder of speeches delivered by Bennet to the New York State Assembly
				in 1901-1902, several folders of material on Bennet's unsuccessful 1936 campaign for
				the Republican Vice Presidential nomination, and collections of political
				memorabilia from various campaigns. In addition, it includes several large
				scrapbooks, the transcription of an oral history interview with Bennet, tax reports
				from the town of Newburgh, a ledger dating from the late nineteenth century, and a
				collection of certificates documenting Bennet's election to various offices.</p>

          <p>This series contains materials related to Bennet's various political
						campaigns as well as several oversized and fragile items. It includes a
						folder of speeches delivered by Bennet to the New York State Assembly in
						1901-1902, several folders of material on Bennet's unsuccessful 1936
						campaign for the Republican Vice Presidential nomination, and collections of
						political memorabilia from various campaigns. In addition, it includes
						several large scrapbooks, the transcription of an oral history interview
						with Bennet, tax reports from the town of Newburgh, a ledger dating from the
						late nineteenth century, and a collection of certificates documenting
						Bennet's election to various offices.</p>
