      <p>The collection was gathered as background information for a 1971 report on campus unrest at
        the request of the Acting Vice President for Academic Affairs by the University Librarian,
        Alice Hastings, Fredericks Volkwein, Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies, and Dr. Frederick
        D. Weinstein of the School of Library Science.</p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>The Campus Unrest Collection focuses on volatile events involving students that occurred at
        the State University of New York at Albany (now the University at Albany), as well as other
        campuses around the country. Inspired by national and local influences, these events
        occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s and involved student-faculty relations, race
        relations, the Vietnam War, and the shootings at Kent State University. All served to raise
        tension among students, faculty and administration, most noticeably during the 1969-1970
        academic year.</p>
      <p>At colleges and universities around the country, this period witnessed the end of the
        institution serving "in loco parentis" or in place of parents. Universities, including the
        State University of New York at Albany, allowed for greater freedom of the student body by
        removing curfews and dress codes. Students transitioned away from older campus traditions
        and established new ones. Many students (and faculty) protested the escalation of U.S.
        troops serving in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>While these national trends were in evidence at the State University of New York at Albany,
        other institution-specific developments also affected campus life. The school became a State
        University of New York (SUNY) University Center in 1962, opened its expanded Uptown Campus
        for classes in the Fall of 1966 and the size of the student body grew exponentially and
        became more diverse. As a result, administrators and faculty no longer shared personal
        connections with as many students, severly affecting two-way communication. The University
        also responded to the heterogeneity of the student population. Then President Evan R.
        Collins created the Afro-American Studies department in January 1969 in direct response to
        demands by an increasing African-American student population, led by the Black Student
        Alliance, for entry level courses in Afro-American studies. The new department offered its
        first courses in Fall 1969. The following year, the Department of Judaic Studies opened.</p>
      <p>On October 15, 1969, the State University of New York at Albany participated in
        events for a national Vietnam Moratorium day. The University held a twenty-four hour vigil
        during which the names of those killed in the Vietnam War were read on the academic podium.
        Speeches and workshops also were held.</p>
      <p>During March 1970, the State University of New York at Albany did not renew the two-year
        contract of popular assistant professor Gerard Wagner of the Department of Rhetoric and
        Public Address. As part of reaction to this news, students protested, some broke windows and
        others occupied the halls outside of Acting President Allan A. Kuusito's office. </p>
      <p>In the early spring of 1970, African-American faculty and students submitted several
        proposals addressing racism on campus to the administration. Proposals included seeking
        better representation of black students among Resident Assistants, hiring of black food
        service workers, and issuance of guidelines to existing staff and faculty about treating all
        students equally. These groups also documnted reports of racial incidents on campus. This
        communication was one part of an ongoing discussion of race relations on the campus. In
        April 1970 African-American students became angered at the policy of checking student
        identification in order to eat in the cafeteria resulting in two incidents in the Colonial
        Quad dining room. According to students, this policy of strict identification checking was
        not the norm in Colonial Quad and some believed that African-American students were unfairly
        singled out. In the more volatile, second incident, approximately 75 students allegedly
        assaulted a cafeteria supervisor, broke windows, threw food and upturned tables.</p>
      <p>Students overall also demanded greater participation in University decision making, especially
        following the anger over the contract renewal debate about Gerard Wagner. In response, the
        University suspended classes and held two Dialogue Days in March of 1970 where students
        attended workshops such as "Legal Procedures - Amnesty for Students," "Racism on Campus,"
        and "50-50 Faculty-Student Control of the University." Departments held meetings with
        students and the Library invited students to come by at any time to meet, convene or suggest
        ideas. As part of the dialogue with faculty and administration, students aired grievances
        about many aspects of University life from the University Senate (more student
        representation necessary) to the Library (request for one central circualtion desk) to
        advising services (inadequate).</p>
      <p>Other sources of tension on campus during 1969-1970 prompted additional student activism.
        These included a women's group's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to establish an on-campus
        child care facility, conflict with the academic calendar and religious holidays, drug
        arrests by police and a People's Park demonstration which delayed construction of two courtyards on the academic podium.</p>
      <p>The events of this volatile school year culminated in May 1970 when the Nixon
        Administration announced U.S. troop movement into Cambodia, touching off unrest at campuses
        across the country, helping lead to the shootings at Kent State on May 4. State University
        of New York at Albany students protested and demonstrated their anger by vandalizing the
        Library on the night of May 4. On May 6, 1500-2000 students gathered en masse and marched to
        downtown Albany where the group burned an effigy of President Richard Nixon and listened to
        speeches. Other disruptions of regular campus activities in the days following Kent State
        included bomb scares, the throwing of fire bombs and Molotov cocktails, destruction of
        campus property in addition to the Library, fires in residence halls and repeated false fire
        alarms. The University also canceled several events including Alumni Day, Parents Weekend
        and a University Community Symphony Orchestra. Many students did not attend classes at the
        end of the semester. Some elected to strike because of the myriad of immediate events, the
        many fire alarms disrupted classes and some students cited fear for their personal safety as
        a reason for leaving campus before the semester officially ended. As a result, President
        Kuusito issued special guidelines and alternatives to faculty on May 12, 1970 regarding the
        completion of course work during a crisis. </p>
      <p>Compared to other colleges and universities in the SUNY system, the State University of New
        York at Albany experienced less vandalism and damage on campus than other schools during
        1969-1970. According to a report prepared by John J. Mather, assistant to SUNY Chancellor
        Samuel B. Gould, and issued in July 1970, the total amount of damages at 26 SUNY schools for
        1969-1970 was $518,000. Albany's share was only $85,000 compared to $233,000 at SUNY
        Buffalo. The bulk of damage occured on and immediately after May 4, 1970.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This is an artificial collection, including correspondence, newspaper clippings, and fliers
        and printed materials, predominantly from 1969–1970, collected to document unrest on the
        State University of New York at Albany campus and at other institutions across the country.
        The majority of the material from the University at Albany details events from the Spring
        Semester 1970. Alice Hastings, the University Librarian, Fredericks Volkwein, Assistant Dean
        of Graduate Studies, and Dr. Frederick D. Weinstein of the School of Library Science
        gathered the collection as background information for a 1971 report on campus unrest at the
        request of the Acting Vice President for Academic Affairs. The report is found in Series
        1.</p>
      <p>Of interest to researchers may be shards of glass resulting from the vandalism and unrest
        on the University at Albany campus following the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970.</p>

          <p>In the summer of 1970, Alice Hasting sent inquiries to other universities asking for background materials documenting the "student unrest movement" on their respecitve campuses.  This series contains the results she received including general information about unrest at colleges and universities across the United States.  There also are folders devoted to the University at Buffalo, Columbia University, Yale University, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin.  The series contains correspondence, reports, newspapers and clippings.  </p>
