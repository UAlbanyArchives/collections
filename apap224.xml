      <head>Acquisition Information</head>
      <p>Frank Becker initially donated his papers to Syracuse University in 1964. The oral history
        interview was posthumously donated in 1982 by Former Members of Congress, Inc. In 2006, all
        the papers were transferred to the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and
        Archives. </p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Frank J. Becker was born in Brooklyn, New York on August 27, 1899 and moved with his family
        to Lynbrook, Long Island in 1905. He attended Brown’s Business College in Jamaica, Long
        Island. Becker enlisted in the United States Army on July 22, 1918 and during World War I
        served overseas in both England and France. In the 1930s, Becker founded a real-estate and
        insurance company, and was chairman emeritus of the Board of Directors of the Suburbia
        Federal Savings and Loan Association in Garden City, Long Island. Becker was an active
        member in both chapters of Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion in Lynbrook in
        addition to being a member of the Knights of Columbus. </p>
      <p>From 1945-1953, Becker served as a member of the New York State Assembly representing
        Nassau County, Long Island. Beginning in 1952, Becker acted as the delegate to the
        Republican National Convention and in November 1952, Becker was elected as a Republican to
        Congress as a New York State Representative for the 3rd District, serving portions of Nassau
        County. In Becker’s final term from 1962-1964, congressional district lines were redrawn
        throughout Nassau County resulting in Becker acting as Representative of the 5th
        District.</p>
      <p>During his terms in office, Becker was part of numerous committees and subcommittees
        including: Ways and Means Committee, Armed Services Committee (including the Subcommittee of
        Research and Development), Joint Legislative Committee for the Study of Military Law
        (specifically 1948-1953), and Charitable and Religions Societies Committee. Towards his
        later years in office, Becker became vocal and the focus of a debate regarding religion in
        schools. Becker sponsored a Constitutional amendment to allow Bible readings and organized
        prayer in public schools with voluntary participation. Following a Supreme Court Decision
        ruling prayer in school to be unconstitutional, the amendment was defeated. </p>
      <p>Becker passed away on September 4, 1981 and is interned at Pine Law National Cemetery,
        Pinelawn, N.Y. Becker was survived by his wife of 58 years and his three children. One of
        his children, Francis X Becker was Mayor of Lynbrook and later served as a New York State
        Supreme Court Justice on Long Island. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The majority of the Frank J. Becker Papers span the years of 1953-1964 and document
        Becker’s tenure in the U.S. Congress representing a portion of Nassau County, New York.
        There also is a 1974 oral history interview with Becker recorded by Former Members of
        Congress, Inc. as part of its project "The Modern Congress in American History." The
        collection contains materials related to his day-to-day activities including correspondence,
        legislative files, subject specific files, printed matter, and items related to committee
        work. The collection does not contain personal correspondence or information regarding
        Becker’s time in the New York State Assembly. </p>
      <p>The series arrangement reflects the way that Becker and his Congressional staff organized
        and filed his papers. The archivist also elected to retain the folder titles created by
        Becker and his staff. As original order is preserved, there is noticeable overlap of
        materials between series. Although Series 2 is entitled “Correspondence”, correspondence
        between Becker and constituents and other representatives and department heads is found
        throughout the entire collection. In addition, Series 4 is entitled “<emph render="italic">Congressional Record</emph>,” but there are clippings from the <emph render="italic">Congressional Record</emph> in other series. </p>
      <p>Please note that in Series 1: Subject Files, materials of personal nature regarding some of
        Becker’s constituents is found in a number of folders and these records are restricted. </p>

      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>

          <p>As a Congressman, Frank Becker interacted with his constituents continually, the most
            common method being through correspondence. The series documents three specific groups
            of individuals that Becker corresponded with: Immigrants (stamped IC on the paperwork),
            Servicemen (stamped SM on the paperwork), and Veterans (stamped VC on the paperwork).
            These are only a few of many groups of people Becker interacted with. However, Becker
            elected to keep this correspondence separate and the archivists maintained this order.
            Additionally, interspersed throughout the series are copies of original public laws, a
            questionnaire, and newspaper clippings.</p>

          <p>This series contains legislation introduced by Frank Becker with related
            correspondence, copies of the bills, reports, and printed matter. For the majority of
            legislative bills through 1962, Becker’s Congressional office created two files – a main
            file and one designated for general correspondence. News releases may be filed in either
            location. All the information contained in the folder titles (the legislation's date of
            introduction, bill number and title) appeared on the original files created by Becker's
            office. The series is arranged by the introduction number of the bills; however related
            materials in the folders may contain additional dates. Please note there is a noticeable
            gap with no legislative files donated for the years between 1957 and 1961.</p>
