      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Donald J. Newman was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on June 4, 1924, the son of Kendell and Catherine (Mahoney) Newman.  Raised in Janesville Dr. Newman served in the Army from 1943 to 1946.  After the army he returned to Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin where he received his bachelor's in psychology (1949), a master's in sociology (1952) and a Ph.D, also in sociology (1954).  In 1949 Dr. Newman married Evelyn S. Zatlin, they later had two sons and one daughter.</p>
      <p>Dr. Newman began his professional career teaching sociology at St. Lawrence University in Canton New York from 1953 until 1960.  He then returned to the University of Wisconsin where he taught law and social work until 1967.  In 1967 Dr. Newman became a professor of criminal justice at SUNY Albany.  He served as Dean of the School of Criminal Justice from 1977 until 1984 when both health problems and disagreements over the inclusion of the school with the administrative framework of Rockefeller College lead to his resignation as Dean.  He continued to serve as a professor in the School of Criminal Justice until his death.</p>
      <p>In addition to his teaching Dr. Newman did extensive consulting work with groups such as the U.S. Justice Department (1971), the New York Department of Corrections (1971-1972), and the Police Foundation (1978).  Along with this he helped shape the direction of criminal justice education through his evaluations of the programs in numerous schools including The University of Nebraska (1976), The University of Minnesota (1978) and the University of Illinois at Chicago (1984)</p>
      <p>Throughout his career Dr. Newman remained interested in plea bargaining, parole and prison conditions, areas in which he was considered the national authority.  Other areas of interest included juvenile delinquency, policing and later in his career elderly criminals.</p>
      <p>Dr. Newman was the author of five books:  <emph render="italic">Conviction: The Determination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial</emph> (1966), <emph render="italic">Criminal Justice Administration</emph> (1969,82), <emph render="italic">Introduction to Criminal Justice</emph> (1975, 1978, 1986, 1989), <emph render="italic"> Elderly Criminals</emph> (1984), and <emph render="italic">Principles of Criminal Justice</emph> (1984).</p>
      <p>Dr. Newman and his first wife were divorced in March 1987.  He later remarried Katherine Blueglass.  Dr. Newman died of a stroke on January 26, 1990 at the age of 65 in Albany N.Y.**</p>
      <p>Note: ** Biographical information taken from Who's Who In America 1988-1989 ed., vol.2 P. 2282 and Dr. Newman's obituary in the New York Times Jan 31, 1990 p.D27.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Donald J. Newman Papers span from 1954 to 1989.  However the bulk of the material spans the period from 1967, the start of his career at SUNY, to the summer of 1983, when Dr. Newman began to face serious medical problems.</p>
      <p>While Dr. Newman performed extensive consulting work with private criminal justice foundations and law enforcement agencies during his career, there are no files relating to this.  However, there are records dealing with evaluations he conducted for universities and colleges, including, in most cases, copies of the evaluations themselves.</p>
      <p>The School of Criminal Justice Records consist of Dr. Newman's personal copies of internal documents relating to his service on School Committees.  For the files that he kept while serving as Dean, 1977-1983, see the School of Criminal Justice Records.</p>
      <p>The Criminal Justice Projects series contains the records of numerous projects that Dr. Newman worked on throughout his career.  These records reflect his interest in prison reform, policing, and juvenile delinquency.  However a large portion of the material consists of reports and studies published by state agencies and used as references by Dr. Newman.  This series does not contain any of his published material.  Also absent are any files relating to his interest in elderly criminals.</p>
      <p>See also the records of the School of Criminal Justice and the Richard Myren Papers.</p>
