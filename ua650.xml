      <p>The School of Education at the State University of New York at Albany was created by an act of the New York State Legislature on May 7, 1844, as the Albany Normal School and modeled on l'Ecole Normale Supérieure in France. Its mission was to educate and train school teachers in the science of education and the art of teaching so that they might take up positions in the schools of both New York State and the rest of the United States. The Albany Normal School opened its doors on December 18, 1844, and started preparing teachers for the state's secondary schools. It offered a two-year teacher preparatory program. The Albany Normal School was the first normal school in the State of New York and the third in the United States. Its first year of funding included a $9,600 subsidy from the state's Literature Fund and the promise of $10,000 annually for the first five years. The Albany Normal School's first class had 29 students.</p>
      <p>In 1905, the mission of the School of Education was expanded to preparing not only secondary school teachers, but also normal school ones. In 1906, graduate study commenced with the introduction of a one-year curriculum of post-baccalaureate study that led to a degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy. The school's two-year program was offered for the last time in 1908. In 1913, master's degree programs were added. In 1960, a doctoral degree in Educational Administration was added to the professional education courses as well as a program leading to a doctorate of philosophy. As the School of Education at the State University of New York at Albany grew, its mission grew in scope to include not only the education of classroom teachers, but also of the leaders who have shaped the nature of learning in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
      <p>Since 1962, the School of Education has grown in size and scope. Its current mission is to foster enhanced learning and human development as well as to advance knowledge concerning the full spectrum of challenges in learning development, behavior, and adaptation. In order to achieve this, the School of Education offers many different academic programs taught by a large and diverse faculty. Currently, the school has four departments: Educational Administration Policy, Educational and Counseling Psychology, Educational Theory and Practice, and Reading. As of 2006, the School of Education had approximately 1400 graduate students, 1400 undergraduate students, 500 undergraduate minors, 95 part-time faculty, 65 full-time faculty, 30 master and Certificate for Advanced Studies programs, 6 doctoral programs, and two online programs.</p>

This series also includes general publications of the School of Education such as annual reports, accreditation reports, directories of faculty and staff by year, telephone directories of the School of Education by year, handbooks for student teaching and for student teachers, and three-year academic plans. The proceedings of conferences include the New York State Education Forum of 1984 and the 1983 conference on electronic learning. Student papers in Box 1 and Box 2 are restricted.

There are also meeting minutes, reports, correspondence and class materials. For an overview of the program's creation, see Box 2, Folder 8, "Report on School of Education", which is composed of materials organized by Paul Bulger and Lou Ismay.</p>
