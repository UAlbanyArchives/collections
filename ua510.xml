      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education is an administrative office that operates under the Office of the Provost (Vice President for Academic Affairs). It is responsible for the coordination of undergraduate academics at the University: including curriculum policy and development, academic counseling and advisement, transfer student support, independent study and internships oversight, and publication of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Materials in this collection include: daily correspondence of Deans of Undergraduate Studies (organized alphabetically in series 2 and by subject in series 3 and 4), budget documentation, faculty policy documentation, committee reports and minutes, conference and retreat materials, department subject files, planning documentation for Project Renaissance (series 5), and other materials that relate to the administration of undergraduate studies at the University.</p>

      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
      <p>Arrangement of this collection is based partly on type of materials and partly on original creator. Series 1 contains the web archives for the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education. Series 2 contains Day Books for several individuals, and materials are presented in their original order. Series 3 and 4 contain materials created, broadly speaking, by different Deans. Series 3 contains the earlier materials, and has been arranged alphabetically in the absence of original order. Series 4 is primarily composed of materials created by Sung Bok Kim during his term as Dean of Undergraduate Studies, and is arranged alphabetically to reflect the order in which the materials were filed by their creator. Series 5: Project Renaissance, contains materials that were found together, but lacked any semblence of order.</p>
