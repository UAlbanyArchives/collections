      <p>Based in Albany, the Capital District Committee for Palestinian Rights (CDCPR) began as an informal coalition of Palestinians, Palestinian-Americans, and supporters in 1982.  The organization was re-energized and changed its name to the Palestinian Rights Committee (PRC) following the September 11, 2001 attack and the United States' governments launch of its War on Terror. The PRC became an affiliate of Upper Hudson Peace Action in January 2008.</p>
