      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Eugene H. McLaren was born in the 1920s and began attending the New York State College for
        Teachers (now the University at Albany) in 1941. His studies were interrupted during World
        War II when he transferred to New York University from 1943-1944, earning a certificate from
        the Air Force Meteorology program. He returned to Albany in 1946, earning his bachelor's
        degree in Science and Mathematics in 1948 and a master's degree in Chemistry in 1949. Next
        McLaren went to the University of Basel in Switzerland to study Advanced German and
        Chemistry until 1950. He returned to the United States to serve as an instructor of
        Chemistry at the New York State College for Teachers, and then studied at Washington
        University in St. Louis from 1952 to 1955, securing a doctorate in Physical Chemistry. While
        pursuing his doctorate, McLaren worked each summer in the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
        in New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Upon earning his Ph. D., McLaren returned to Albany to become an Associate Professor of
        Chemistry at the New York State College for Teachers from 1955-1957. After a three year
        break as a Senior Research Chemist at the Pan American Petroleum Corporation in Tulsa,
        Oklahoma, he returned to Albany to become a full Professor of Chemistry in 1960, a position
        that he held until his retirement in 1989. Upon his return, McLaren also became a Professor
        of Science and Chairman for the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences until 1962.
        McLaren then became a Chairman for the Division of Science and Mathematics until 1968. In
        1968, McLaren was appointed Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for a year;
        along with becoming a member of the Board of Directors for the Bulletin of the Atomic
        Scientists. He then became a Research Associate of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center
        in 1969. McLaren was also a University Fellow and Research Associate at the
        Max-Planck-Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany from 1969-1970. McLaren would return to
        Germany as a Visiting Professor at the University of Frankfurt from 1984-1985.</p>
      <p>During his career, McLaren was a member of several professional societies, including the
        American Chemical Society, the American Meteorological Society, the Society of Sigma Xi, the
        Geochemical Society, the New York Academy of Science, and the Air Pollution Control
        Association, and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He
        also worked alongside several well-known meteorologists such as Vincent Schaefer and Bernard
        Vonnegut, and conducted research throughout his career.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection covers Eugene McLaren’s professional activities while employed at the
        University at Albany, both administrative and research related. The papers are predominantly
        limited to only Albany, there are few records of his involvements in Germany with the
        exceptions of the Wuerzburg Study Abroad Program and U.S.-European research
        collaborations.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the papers date from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, covering McLaren's
        tenure as Professor of Chemistry at the University. Any documents outside of that range are
        either research materials or pertain to one of his colleagues. The collection is split into 
        two series, one for his research and one for his academic papers. McLaren's research work
        involved collaboration with European colleagues and attending conferences, as well as 
        participating in research expeditions. Correspondences from these interactions are included
        in the collection, along with research notes from various projects. Of most note is work
        regarding Project Cirrus and strong acid formation in fog, with some additional findings 
        recorded during the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center's annual Yellowstone Research
        Expedition.</p>
      <p>As part of his academic service, McLaren was a member of a number of small committees that
        had a very wide variety of purposes ranging from the Alumni Day Committee to the Wuerzburg
        Study Abroad Committee. Materials from these committees is found within the collection. Of
        interest also may be several booklets and papers documenting the opening of the Uptown
        Campus of the University at Albany, and publications of the Atmospheric Sciences Research
        Center.</p>

          <p>This series consists of McLaren’s administrative papers. It is predominantly composed
            of memorandums and correspondences documenting his involvement with a large number of
            different committees throughout his tenure at the University Albany. Most notable in
            size are the applications for the Husted Award, an annual award granted to the most 
            outstanding undergraduate senior in science, which he was involved with from
            1977 until his retirement in 1989. This series also contains his general papers, some
            teaching materials, and several booklets on the history of the University at Albany’s
            Uptown Campus.</p>

          <p>This series consists of McLaren’s research papers. Most prominent is his work on strong
            acid formation in fog, research conducted from 1983 to 1986. Also included are notes
            from various conferences he attended, Atmospheric Sciences Research Center publications,
            papers regarding research trips to Yellowstone National Park along with Whiteface
            Mountain and Europe, and his involvement with Project Cirrus, a weather modification
            program conducted by General Electric in conjunction with the United States military.
