      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Eugene H. McLaren was born in the 1920s and began attending the New York State College for Teachers (now the University at Albany) in 1941. His studies were interrupted during World War II when he transferred to New York University from 1943-1944, earning a certificate from the Air Force Meteorology program. He returned to Albany in 1946, earning his bachelor's degree in Science and Mathematics in 1948 and a master's degree in Chemistry in 1949. Next McLaren went to the University of Basel in Switzerland to study Advanced German and Chemistry until 1950. He returned to the United States to serve as an instructor of Chemistry at the New York State College for Teachers, and then studied at Washington University in St. Louis from 1952 to 1955, securing a doctorate in Physical Chemistry. While pursuing his doctorate, McLaren worked each summer in the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico.</p>
      <p> Upon earning his Ph. D., McLaren returned to Albany to become an Associate Professor of Chemistry at the New York State College for Teachers from 1955-1957. After a three year break as a Senior Research Chemist at the Pan American Petroleum Corporation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he returned to Albany to become a full Professor of Chemistry in 1960, a position that he held until his retirement in 1989. Upon his return, McLaren also became a Professor of Science and Chairman for the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences until 1962. McLaren then became a Chairman for the Division of Science and Mathematics until 1968. In 1968, McLaren was appointed Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for a year; along with becoming a member of the Board of Directors for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. He then became a Research Associate of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center in 1969. McLaren was also a University Fellow and Research Associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany from 1969-1970. McLaren would return to Germany as a Visiting Professor at the University of Frankfurt from 1984-1985.</p>
      <p> During his career, McLaren was a member of several professional societies, including the American Chemical Society, the American Meteorological Society, the Society of Sigma Xi, the Geochemical Society, the New York Academy of Science, and the Air Pollution Control Association, and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also worked alongside several well-known meteorologists such as Vincent Schaefer and Bernard Vonnegut, and conducted research throughout his career.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection covers Eugene McLaren’s professional activities while employed at the University at Albany, both administrative and research related. The papers are predominantly limited to only Albany, there are few records of his involvements in Germany with the exceptions of the Wuerzburg Study Abroad Program and U.S.-European research collaborations.</p>
      <p> The bulk of the papers date from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, covering McLaren's tenure as Professor of Chemistry at the University. Any documents outside of that range are either research materials or pertain to one of his colleagues. The collection is split into two series, one for his research and one for his academic papers. McLaren's research work involved collaboration with European colleagues and attending conferences, as well as participating in research expeditions. Correspondences from these interactions are included in the collection, along with research notes from various projects. Of most note is work regarding Project Cirrus and strong acid formation in fog, with some additional findings recorded during the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center's annual Yellowstone Research Expedition.</p>
      <p> As part of his academic service, McLaren was a member of a number of small committees that had a very wide variety of purposes ranging from the Alumni Day Committee to the Wuerzburg Study Abroad Committee. Materials from these committees is found within the collection. Of interest also may be several booklets and papers documenting the opening of the Uptown Campus of the University at Albany, and publications of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center.</p>
      <p> For related materials, please see the following collections held by the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collection &amp; Archives: Atmospheric Sciences Research Center Records (UA-450), which includes many publications and articles issued by the ASRC, Duncan Blanchard Papers (UA-902.065), Raymond Falconer Papers (UA-902.014), Bernard Vonnegut Papers (UA-902.068) and Vincent J. Schaefer Papers (UA-902.010).</p>

          <p>This series consists of McLaren’s administrative papers. It is predominantly composed of memorandums and correspondences documenting his involvement with a large number of different committees throughout his tenure at the University Albany. Most notable in size are the applications for the Husted Award, an annual award granted to the most outstanding undergraduate senior in science, which he was involved with from 1977 until his retirement in 1989. This series also contains his general papers, some teaching materials, and several booklets on the history of the University at Albany’s Uptown Campus.</p>
