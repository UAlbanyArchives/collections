      <p>The Clarence Hancock Papers were originally donated to Syracuse University on September 21,
        1962 by Hancock's wife and son. The papers were transferred to M.E. Grenander Department of
        Special Collections at the State University of New York, Albany in 2006.</p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Clarence Eugene Hancock was born in Syracuse, NY on February 13, 1885 to Theodore E. and
        Martha Hancock. After public school, Hancock attended Wesleyan University in Middletown
        Connecticut until his graduation in 1906. Hancock graduated from New York Law School in 1908
        and was admitted to the bar in the same year. Once he was admitted to the bar, he began to
        practice law in Syracuse. From 1916-1917, Hancock served as a sergeant with Troop D of the
        First New York Cavalry, also known as New York National Guard, on the Mexican border.
        Hancock next served as a lieutenant with the 104th Machine Gun Battalion in the 27th
        division during World War One. After the armistice in 1918, Hancock was assigned to work as
        Assistant Division Judge Advocate and promoted to the rank of captain. Hancock continued to
        serve in the military until 1919.</p>
      <p>After finishing his military service, Hancock returned home and became part of the
        corporation counsel of Syracuse from 1926-1927 and a trustee of Wesleyan University. During
        this period, Hancock ran in the Republican primary for mayor of Syracuse but lost the
        nomination. Then, during the 70th Congress, the current representative of the 35th district,
        Walter W. Magee, died in office leaving his position open. Voters elected Hancock to fill
        Magee's position in 1927 and he continued to serve as representative of the 35th district
        until 1945 when there was re-districting. Hancock was then elected as the representative of
        the 36th district from 1945-1947. While in Congress, Hancock served on the Judicial
        Committee, Naval Affairs Committee, and Elections No. 1 Committee. Along with this, he was
        chairman of the speaker's bureau of the Republican Congressional Committee and head of the
        Eastern Speaker's Bureau in 1936. Hancock was part of the opposition to President Franklin
        D. Roosevelt's New Deal plan.</p>
      <p>Hancock did not seek reelection in 1946 for the next session of Congress because of a long
        time illness and the recommendation of his doctor that he should rest. After leaving
        Congress, Hancock returned to Syracuse to practice law but died in a hospital in Washington
        D.C. a year later on January 3, 1948. He was survived by his wife, Emily W. Shonk of
        Plymouth, Pennsylvania, whom he married in 1912, and son, John S. Hancock, born in 1914. He
        is buried in Woodland Cemetery in Syracuse.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Clarence Hancock was a New York State Representative in the United States Congress from
        1927-1947. His collection includes correspondence, newspaper clippings, Congressional bills,
        transcripts of Congressional hearings, telegrams, and handwritten notes. Much of the
        correspondence is from constituents and fellow Congressmen, and discusses their opinions
        about a particular bill and the actions they want taken. The collection covers Hancock's
        official actions as a New York Congressional Representative from 1933-1946 and does not
        include personal papers or records of his legislative actions from 1934, 1936, 1938 or 1947.
        Please note that no papers about Hancock's work outside of Congress or the work he conducted
        as part of the Naval Affairs or Elections Committees are included in this collection. Some
        areas of interest in the files include the Equal Rights Amendment, Anti-Trust laws,
        Submerged Oil Lands, War and Emergency Powers, and Bankruptcy hearings.</p>
      <p>The majority of the file names are names that Hancock assigned them based on handwritten
        slips of paper the archivist found within the original folders in the collection. If there
        was no paper indicating the file's name, the archivist chose a name based on the subject of
        the records. All the files are arranged alphabetically. Within the files, items are arranged
        based on the year of their creation.</p>
