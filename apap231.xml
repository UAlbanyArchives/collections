      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Daniel Evan Button was a U.S. Representative from New York. Button was born in Dunkirk,
        Chautauqua County, NY on November 1, 1917. He graduated from Wilmington High School
        (Delaware) in 1933, received his A.B. from the University of Delaware (Newark, DE) in 1938,
        and his M.A. from Columbia University in 1939. Button was an author and journalist who
        worked at newspapers in Wilmington, with the Associated Press in New York City (1939-1947)
        and as executive editor of the <emph render="italic">Albany Times-Union</emph> (1960-1966).
        He served as the assistant to the president of the State University of New York (1952-1958)
        as well as on the staffs of the University of Delaware and Rensselaer Polytechnic
        Institute.</p>
      <p>Button was elected in 1966 as a Republican in the 29th district, which includes Albany and
        Schenectady counties, as well as part of Rensselaer County. At this time, the 29th
        district’s population was approximately 462,338 citizens. Button was part of the 90th and
        the subsequent Congress (January 3, 1967-January 3, 1971), but was an unsuccessful candidate
        for reelection in 1970. While serving as a U.S. Representative, Button was on the Merchant
        Marine and Fisheries, and Post Office and Civil Services Committees. While in office, he was
        critical of the war in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Button wrote two books, <emph render="italic">Lindsay, A Man for Tomorrow</emph> (1965) and
          <emph render="italic">Take City Hall</emph> (2003). He also was editor for <emph render="italic">Science Digest</emph> from 1976 to 1980. </p>
      <p>Button was the president of the board of directors of the Clinton Square Neighborhood House
        and Citizens Committee for Albany Public Schools as well as for the Arthritis Foundation
        (1971-1975). He was director of the Council of Community Services, a trustee of the
        Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television, and active on the boards of the World
        Affairs Council, as well as the American Association for the United Nations, Albany Fair
        Housing Committee, the Albany YWCA, and Citizens Planning Committee. In addition, Button was
        co-moderator for the television program, “Speak for Yourself.” </p>
      <p>Button died of pneumonia on May 7, 2009 at age 91 and is buried in Albany Rural Cemetery in
        Menands, New York. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection documents the political life of Daniel Evan Button. This collection
        represents Button’s administrative actions during his two terms as a U.S. Representative:
        his contributions to legislation, files he received concerning domestic concerns and foreign
        relations, a sizable amount of correspondence he received from Albany residents, military
        case files for every military branch, as well as press releases and teleprompter papers for
        televised events.</p>
      <p>Button served on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee as well as the Post Office and
        Civil Services Commission. Materials related to these assignments are dispersed throughout
        the collection, primarily in subject files and subject correspondence. Button also sponsored
        several bills pertaining to these two committees. </p>
      <p>While in office, Joseph or “Joe” Parillo was Button’s personal assistant in his Schenectady
        office. Also, Button had at least two secretaries who assisted him with his correspondence
        and case files. There are a number of records that contain notes regarding cases from these
        personnel. </p>
      <p>Please note there is no material concerning Button’s two books in this collection. There is
        also no material about his work at <emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph>, University at
        Albany, or his contributions to different societies. The entirety of this collection is from
        his time as U.S. Representative. </p>

          <p>This series contains material about Albany, national and world events during the late
            1960s. There is notable information about Albany’s Arbor Hill neighbrohood, Schenectady
            plants, and General Electric. There is also material concerning Laos, Cambodia, ALCO,
            and AID. There are pamphlets and booklets about current events.</p>
          <p>Series 2 also contains information about what Button called an “unholy wedlock” between
            conservative Republicans and Democrats. Button stated it was the first time in New York
            State history that the conservative party endorsed a “slate of” Democrats in a county
            election.</p>

          <p>This series contains correspondence regarding specific subjects during Button’s time as
            a U.S. Representative. Many of his constituents ask him for White House flags and
            agricultural yearbooks, but there are other notable topics as well. These include
            Albany’s Arbor Hill neighborhood (attempts to better the community), General Electric,
            Laos, Cambodia, protest letters, requests for Congressional intervention, questions
            about HUAC, the Chicago 7, Vietnam, the Cold War, and President Richard Nixon. </p>
          <p>This material is arranged by subject and is primarily incoming mail. Outgoing mail is
            located in Correspondence.</p>

          <p>This material is all outgoing correspondence from Daniel Button. It is arranged
            according to its original order, chronologically and then alphabetically. The files are
            color-coordinated by year and then listed in precise alphabetical order. All incoming
            correspondence is in either subject correspondence or case files. Also, the material has
            not been organized like Button's incoming mail, which he separated by individual case.
            He arranged his outgoing mail into large folders of A, B, C, etc. </p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>There are three types of case files that Daniel Button created: Military approval
            applications, requests for military discharges/reassignment, and Albany-related
            problems. These are organized chronologically and then alphabetically by the last name
            of the individual concerned in the case file. The military requests are restricted
            because the military applications reveal personal information, such as medical
            examination records, social security numbers, and school grades. The military hardship
            discharges are restricted because they contain sensitive information regarding
            individuals and their families. The other cases are a broad range of requests, many of
            which concern postage and censoring, notably obscene advertisements in mail, which
            Button wrote house Resolutions against. Other requests concern visas, political opinions
            on the Vietnam War, questions about Vietnam, the Cold War, and other current events.
            There are also a few requests concerning moving costs, patents, and radioactive
            contamination.</p>
          <p> The case files are individual, so there are at least 200 folders within each Series 5
            box.</p>

          <p>This series contains many press releases concerning new bills, Button's comments on
            current events and materials related to Button's speaking engagements. There are a
            number of teleprompt papers from televised events. The teleprompt paper remains
            connected together like an accordion and is delicate to handle. There are also a number
            of different drafts of Button's speeches, with handwritten revisions. </p>
