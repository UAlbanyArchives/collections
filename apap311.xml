      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Atlantic States Legal Foundation, Inc. (ASLF) is a not-for-profit organization founded in
        1982, with headquarters in Syracuse, New York. Since its earliest years, Samuel Sage has
        worked with ASLF, actively promoting numerous environmental projects and serving as
        president. ASLF’s mission is to provide affordable technical, legal and organizational
        services to a variety of individuals, community groups, non-governmental organizations
        (NGOs), local governments and others to protect and remediate threats to the natural and
        human environment. </p>
      <p> In the 1980s and 1990s ASLF used the legal frame work of the Federal Water Pollution
        Control Act, known as the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know
        Act (EPCRA) to ensure industrial pollution was in compliance with permits issued by the
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The CWA is a federal law passed in 1976, which set
        water pollution standards to levels safe for human recreation. The EPCRA, passed in 1986,
        enabled private citizens and NGOs to request federal and state agencies documents such as,
        Material Safety Data Sheets, Toxic Release Inventories, SARA Title III Reports, Discharge
        Permits and Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMR) for individual companies. Often, the copying
        fees for these reports were waived for ASLF because it is a not-for-profit organization.
        ASLF used these reports to identify pollution discharge violations throughout the United
        States and U.S. Territories. After violations were identified, a sixty day notice of the
        intent to sue would be sent to the permit violating company. Often agreement settlements
        were negotiated before reaching court. The cases that did reach the courts were citizen
        suits and ASLF, as an organization, often needed an individual, affiliated with ASLF, in the
        affected area who could demonstrate harm. These individuals could provide standing for the
        case and were often members of ASLF or of a community group working with ASLF.</p>
      <p> On November 28, 1990 ASLF was the first ever to settle an EPCRA citizen suit. ASLF became
        the leading NGO utilizing the citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Act to enforce
        disclosure and compliance with pollution permits. ASLF worked with local individuals and
        community groups, such as the Sierra Club and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, to discover and
        bring legal claim against polluters. In addition to working with local groups, ASLF often
        worked through local attorneys in distant states, to manage the handling of a case. </p>
      <p>In 1998 the effectiveness of citizen suits was curtailed due to a U.S. Supreme Court
        decision. However, ASLF's efforts forced many industries and companies to be accountable to
        their local communities. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The collection contains materials relating to the projects and cases pursued by ASLF,
        ASLF's collection of published environmental reports and newsletters, and subject files.
        ASLF activities encompassed almost every U.S. state and a few U.S. territories. The projects
        and cases are arranged by geographic regions, state, and finally alphabetically by the
        company or organization. The publications are arranged alphabetically, with separation
        between serial publications, New York publications, New York Department of Environmental
        Conservation (DEC) publications, and other publications.</p>
      <p>The collection contains materials from the 1960s to 2000s. However the bulk of the projects
        were pursued in the 1980s and 1990s, items which pre- or post-date this range are often
        research material, DMRs or compliance reports required by consent decrees. </p>
      <p>The collection consists of correspondence, compliance reports, discharge monitoring reports
        (DMR), court documents, architectural drawings, laboratory analyses, notes, news clippings,
        National Discharge Elimination Permit System (NPDES) permits, photographs, quarterly
        non-compliance reports (QNCR), remediation programs, standing, subject files, workshops and
        environmental newsletters, studies and research reports.</p>

              Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,
              South Dakota and Wisconsin. In the Midwest ASLF sought to clean up the Great Lakes,
              and the Mississippi River region. The case against Koch Refining Co. in Minnesota,
              removed a major source of toxins in the Mississippi River and ensured compliance for
              many years afterwards. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, at the request of local activists ASLF
              researched DMRs and discovered almost a quarter of Fort Wayne industries’ had a
              history of CWA violations. </p>

            <p>This subseries documents ASLF's projects in the Northeast states, including:
              Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York,
              Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. The majority of the northeast projects are
              from ASLF’s home state of New York. The first ever Right-to-Know Act citizen suit was
              settled in 1990 by ASLF in a landmark settlement involving ARO Corporation, located in
              Buffalo. In Syracuse, Onondaga Lake, which was considered one of the most polluted
              lakes in the United States during the late 1980s, was a focus of ASLF efforts. ASLF
              settled several cases, including one against Bristol Meyers Squib, to reduce
              pollutions discharged in to the lake and remediate damages. </p>
            <p> In the case against Reynolds Metals Co. the court’s decision clarified that the
              discharge of pollutants not specifically regulated by permit was illegal in New York.
              Eastman Kodak Co. was another important project for ASLF, in which pollutants were
              discharged without permit. However, the citizen suit was dismissed as moot after the
              company and the DEC entered a consent decree, which effectively contradicted the
              decision in the Reynolds Metals Co. case. </p>

            <p>This subseries documents ASLF's projects in the Southwest states, including: Arizona,
              New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The majority of projects are from Arizona, where
              ASLF's Southwest Environmental Project (SWEP) worked in conjunction with local
              attorneys and local community groups, such as, Don’t Waste Arizona. Several of the
              cases involved landfills in Cochise County which were closed or scheduled to close.

          <p>This series contains primarily environmental, scientific and legal journals, magazines,
            newsletters, reports, analyses, studies, and other publications collected by the ASLF.
            The majority of materials address environmental issues or geographic areas specific to
            New York State, although the Midwest is well represented. The series is divided into
            four subseries - serials, New York publications, New York State Department of
            Environmental Conservation publications and publications about issues outside of New
            York.</p>

            <p>subseries consists of the serials and external publications sent to, and collected
              by, members of the ASLF. Topics primarily focus on environmental issues, many of which
              are community-specific. Publication formats include magazines, newsletters,
              newspapers, pamphlets, and reports. Please note that the archivist filed all
              publication titles by the full name, rather than by the publishing organization’s
              acronym; exceptions are minimal, and only occur when the acronym is part of the
              publication title.</p>

            <p>This series contains reports and other official publications about issues affecting
              New York State. Federal, state, county and city governments and their agencies,
              including the Environmental Protection Agency or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration, published the majority of these reports. Universities and non-profit
              organizations issued a smaller number. For reports specifically written by the New
              York State Department of Environmental Conservation, please see Series 2, Subseries 3. </p>
            <p>The publications discuss many environmental topics, such as hazardous waste or marine
              and coastal life. There are publications which analyze specific geographic areas,
              including the Long Island Sound, Lake George-Upper Hudson and the St. Lawrence River.
              As the Atlantic States Legal Foundation is based in Syracuse, there are a number of
              general reports and comprehensive planning documents about that city. Files also may
              contain supplemental materials related to the respective report such as an
              accompanying cover letter or news release. </p>

            <p>This series consists of publications about environmental issues and geographic
              regions outside of New York. Reports are authored by federal, state, county and city
              governments and their agencies, universities, and non-profit organizations.
              Publications discuss broader national issues such as chemicals in local communities,
              transportation and American rivers. However, the majority of reports address specific
              geographic areas and their respective problems. This includes pollution in Alaska,
              Great Lakes water quality and overall health, wildlife habitat in Illinois, toxic
              pollution in Rhode Island, and fauna and sediments in the Detroit River. Files also
              may include supplemental materials related to the respective report such as an
              accompanying cover letter.</p>
