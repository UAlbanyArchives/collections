      <abstract label="Abstract:"> The M. Watt Espy papers chronicle the extensive research efforts
        that led to the creation of the Capital Punishment Research Project and the database known
        as the Espy File. Espy spent three decades gathering and indexing documentation of legal
        executions in the United States. His papers contain both primary and secondary sources used
        to catalog thousands of instances of capital punishment in the United States and its
        territories since the 1600s. The collection includes material from corrections records,
        newspapers, county histories, legal proceedings, and books. In addition to the records
        pertaining specifically to the death penalty, there is also a selection of magazines
        collected by Espy that cover true crime stories as well as life in the American Old
        West.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>M. Watt Espy, Jr. (1933-2009) was widely recognized as one of the foremost historians of
        legal executions in the United States. Beginning with his own personal resources, in May
        1970, Espy began the first serious quest to chronicle and document more than 15,000
        government-sanctioned executions in the United States since 1608—an effort that formally
        became the Capital Punishment Research Project. His method was to collect information by
        obtaining state Department of Corrections records, newspapers, published and unpublished
        county histories, proceedings of state and local courts, magazines, and holdings of
        historical societies, libraries, museums, and archives.</p>
      <p>Initially Espy accumulated and recorded information about executions in the United States
        from his home in Headland, Alabama as a part-time pursuit while working in sales. Between
        1977 and 1985, however, the University of Alabama Law Center in Tuscaloosa hired Espy to
        continue his work and during this time he published “Capital Punishment and Deterrence: What
        the Statistics Cannot Show”, <title><emph render="italic">Crime &amp;
          Delinquency</emph></title>, (Vol. 26, No. 4, 537-544 (1980). He also wrote numerous
        opinion editorials and histories of the death penalty for major daily newspapers, including
        the <title><emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph></title>, <title><emph render="italic"> The Atlanta Constitution</emph></title>, <title><emph render="italic">The Virginian-Pilot</emph></title>, <title><emph render="italic">The Columbus
            Dispatch</emph></title>, the <title><emph render="italic">St. Louis
          Post-Dispatch</emph></title>, and <title><emph render="italic">The Nashville
            Tennessean</emph></title>, throughout the 1980s. In 1984, the National Science
        Foundation awarded a grant to support the preparation of a comprehensive computer database
        with Espy’s exhaustive research as its foundation.</p>
      <p>In 1987, that database became a reality when the Inter-University Consortium for Political
        and Social Research (ICPSR) published a dataset, <title><emph render="italic">Executions in
            the United States, 1608-1987: The Espy File</emph></title> (ICPSR 51). The portable data
        file furnishes information on executions performed under civil authority in the United
        States between 1608 and July 6, 1987, and describes each individual executed and the
        circumstances surrounding the crime for which the person was convicted. Variables include
        age, race, name, occupation, and sex of the individual; date, jurisdiction, place, and
        method of execution; and the crime committed. Also recorded is whether the only evidence for
        the execution was official records indicating that an executioner or slave owner received
        compensated for an execution. The Espy File was subsequently updated to include executions
        through 2002.</p>
      <p>The Espy File is based on several ledgers that Espy used to confirm an execution. In one
        ledger, he arranged executions alphabetically by state and then in chronological order. Espy
        recorded the name, race, age and occupation of the offender, county of conviction, crime,
        date and method of execution. A second ledger contained the same cases listed
        chronologically, beginning with 1608. Espy included just the name of the individual, the
        crime, and date, location, and method of execution. A third, and much smaller ledger, also
        is arranged by year and contains post-Furman executions beginning in 1986. There is also a
        page for new confirmations from nineteenth and earlier twentieth century dates.</p>
      <p>Espy’s work went beyond simply tallying the total number of executions. Instead he
        passionately researched and gathered all available background information on those executed,
        writing detailed note cards, narratives, and the ledger entries, which are all included in
        the collection. He painstakingly sought confirmation that officials carried out even the
        most obscure death sentences. Espy innovatively utilized antebellum state and county warrant
        records outlining compensation for executed slaves in his research. He explored the lesser
        known area of juvenile executions, documenting cases where children and teenagers received
        death sentences. Espy chronicled gruesome capital punishments for participants in slave
        rebellions during the colonial period. In addition, he uncovered botched executions where
        law enforcement hanged or electrocuted the same man more than once to complete the death
        sentence. As a further indication of his all-consuming interest in researching capital
        punishment, Espy filled the walls of his home with photographs of individuals executed.</p>
      <p>Although he attended the University of Alabama for two years following service in the
        United States Navy during the Korean War, Espy never received a college degree. However,
        through his work, he earned the respect and admiration of academics, advocacy groups, and
        members of the general public. In 1991 the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty
        honored Espy with a special award at its annual meeting. His professional relationships with
        noted death penalty abolitionists, sociologists, criminal justice professors, authors,
        lawyers, members of Congress, and advocacy group executives are detailed in his
        correspondence. This group includes such notables as former director of the American Civil
        Liberties Union Capital Punishment Project <persname>Henry Scharwzchild</persname> and
        leading experts on capital punishment Dr. <persname>Hugo Bedau,</persname> and Dr.
          <persname>Michael Radelet</persname>, who once commented that “’[Espy] is widely
        recognized by everyone in the academic world as America’s foremost death penalty historian."
        (Ronald Smothers, “Headland Journal; Historian's Death Penalty Obsession,” The New York
        Times, October 21, 1987.) Letters describe how public defender offices and defense attorneys
        hired Espy to research past crimes and executions as part of mounting a defense in capital
        cases. Prisoners exchanged correspondence with him for insights gleaned from his work and
        moral support. (Series 5: Correspondence).</p>
      <p>Following his affiliation with the University of Alabama Law Center, Espy continued to
        research and document executions, write, consult, and lecture from his home base in Headland
        until his death in August 2009. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The M. Watt Espy Papers document more than three decades of research from the nationally
        recognized expert on legal executions in the United States. Beginning as a macabre hobby in
        1970, M. Watt Espy, Jr. began chronicling tens of thousands of government-sanctioned capital
        punishment sentences from the colonial period until the present day. His solitary hobby
        eventually became an all-consuming passion and he embarked upon a full-time career as the
        commanding force behind the Capital Punishment Research Project.</p>
      <p>In 1987, <title><emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph></title> profiled Espy, his
        work and his “death penalty obsession” stating: “By all accounts Watt Espy’s collection is
        as unique as he is eccentric.” This statement remains an accurate description of Espy’s
        materials and the death penalty researcher himself. The collection includes Espy's vast
        documentation of executions in America, including a series of typed index cards listing
        individuals executed. Espy’s method was to collect information by obtaining state Department
        of Corrections records, newspaper articles, published and unpublished county histories,
        proceedings of state and local courts, magazines, and holdings of historical societies,
        libraries, museums, and archives. In addition, there is aggregated research data,
        administrative files, general subject research and notes, professional correspondence, news
        articles about or citing Espy, statements to the media, copies of his published and
        unpublished writings (including numerous opinion editorials), texts of speeches and
        testimonials before government panels, a personal signed portrait and autograph collection,
        scholarly works by others writing in the fields of history, crime, capital punishment, and
        the legal system, materials from advocacy organizations, photographs of individuals
        executed, and true crime, penitentiary, and general interest publications and books.
        Although the materials in the collection include eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth
        century dates of creation, please note many of these items are photocopies of originals.</p>
      <p>The collection also documents Espy’s research and thought process over the course of more
        than three decades. Espy’s materials illustrate the shift of research methodologies of the
        1970s and 1980s through the twenty-first century. While he began by spending countless hours
        typing up correspondence to libraries, archives and historical societies, and scouring
        microfilm, the later portions of the collection include e-mail correspondence and news
        articles culled from the Internet. Of note, Espy rejected his earlier beliefs favoring
        capital punishment and over time became a critic of executions, arguing they did not deter
        future criminal acts and objecting to the number of individuals executed who were not
        guilty. </p>

        others, and advocacy. The index card files are arranged alphabetically by state, then
        alphabetically by person's name within each state. Documentation of executions are arranged
        in subseries based on Espy's own categorization: the 50 states/District of
        Columbia/territories, federal, military, Native American tribal, and international.
        Correspondence is subdivided into regular communication/people of prominence and general
        communication, then is alphabetical within those two groups. Publications are alphabetical
        by title, then chronological within each title.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>Watt Espy kept a series of index cards, grouped mainly by state, that records
            information about executions on American soil (colonies, states, territories) since the
            1600s. Some cards contain lots of information, including name, place of execution,
            method, and details of the crime. Other cards have very little information aside from
            the fact that someone was executed. Sometimes there is not even a name—just “two slaves”
            or “pirate”. There are additional categories for federal, military, and Indian tribal
            executions. There are two different card sizes; for the 3x5 inch cards, each state,
            territory, or other main division is identified with a manila tab. Subdivisions are
            marked with blue, unlined cards and are intended to mirror the arrangement of materials
            in Series #2 as closely as possible.</p>
          <p>In addition to Espy’s numerous 3x5 inch cards, there is also an assortment of 4x6 inch
            cards used in cases where Espy continued information for prisoners who had lengthy
            and/or unusual details regarding their crimes and punishments. Nearly every state is
            featured in this category, as well as Guam, Indian tribal, military, and federal
            executions. Since Espy did not have surplus information to match every 3x5 card, the 4x6
            cards are a much smaller group. Researchers will know when to refer to the larger index
            cards because Espy noted “see large card” on the 3x5 size where appropriate. The 4x6
            cards do not have any subdivisions and are arranged alphabetically by state, then
            alphabetically by prisoner name within each state.</p>
          <p>Special notes for 3x5 index cards:</p>
          <p>1. Slave states of the South, as well as colonial states of the North, usually have an
            extra category of cards: compensation paid to owners whose slaves were executed for
            crimes. Espy was the first researcher to track that information. However, cards showing
            compensation paid to sheriffs for carrying out executions are not separated into their
            own group.</p>
          <p>2. Espy marked certain cards “unconfirmed” if he did not have sufficient evidence that
            an execution was carried out. Other cards indicate that an individual (or individuals)
            received a death sentence, but there is neither an “unconfirmed” notation nor date of
            death. Those cards have been categorized by the archivist as additional unconfirmed
            executions.</p>
          <p>3. Researchers might want to search more than one category within a state, because some
            executions fit more than one description. Ex. “Female slave” executed 1858 whose owner
            was paid $400 would fit the categories of anonymous executions and slave owner
            compensations, but would only be filed in the latter. Ex. #2: “Man and Woman” possibly
            hanged in Kentucky, 1820s—would be filed in unconfirmed executions, not the anonymous
            group.</p>
          <p>4. Card files include military executions and lynchings although neither were a main
            focus of Espy’s research.</p>
          <p>5. Cards that name 3 or more individuals executed are in order by whoever’s name would
            properly be first alphabetically, even if Espy did not list that person’s name first.
            Ex: Dennis Igoe, James Johnson, and Joseph Frampton- Frampton is first alphabetically
            and is filed as such although his name is listed last on Espy’s index card.</p>
          <p>6. Many of the 3x5 card subdivisions identified by blue cards are organized
            alphabetically, but due to time constraints, the slave owner compensation categories are
            not alphabetized.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>This series comprises the bulk of Watt Espy’s primary and secondary research and is
            therefore the largest in the collection. Initially, approximately half of these
            documentation of execution records were arranged in an organized fashion alphabetically
            by state, or by federal, military, tribal or international categories and then
            alphabetically by an individual’s name. The others were not arranged in any discernable
            scheme with a significant amount of materials kept as unorganized loose documents in
            boxes. Espy marked some files as "not written up," but it was ultimately unclear how
            these differed from other records. After careful review, the archivists decided to
            combine all of the documentation of executions together, divided the records into five
            subseries for executions conducted by all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
            federal executions, military executions, Native American tribal executions, and
            international executions, and subsequently arranged and inter-filed all the loose
            materials.</p>
          <p>This series consists of state Department of Corrections records, newspapers, published
            and unpublished state and county histories, proceedings of state and local courts,
            magazines, holdings of historical societies, libraries, museums, and archives, notes
            taken by Espy or others conducting research, lists of individuals executed by state or
            county, annotated photocopies of Espy’s index card files, and documentation of
            executions sent via correspondence. The amount of material varies greatly by individual.
            Individuals are referred to by last name or, in the absence of a surname, by their given
            name. In general, date ranges for this series are not inclusive. Although the folders
            include eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth century dates of creation, please
            note many of these items are photocopies of originals that Espy utilized for his
            research.</p>
          <p>In addition, Espy frequently grouped together materials for individuals executed for
            the same crime or executed on the same day for different crimes. Therefore he often had
            only one set of records for two people executed for the same crime. The archivists filed
            these records under the name of the individual whose last name or given name was
            alphabetically first.</p>
          <p>The respective volumes of aggregated material suggest Espy focused heavily on U.S.
            state and federal executions, and not military, tribal or international ones. The state
            subseries is the largest of the five and documents executions in the United States by
            state or in the District of Columbia. It also includes executions in colonies or
            territories that later became states. The files are arranged alphabetically by state and
            then alphabetically by the last name of the individual executed when one or two people
            received the death penalty. Next are files containing references to multiple executions,
            three or more individuals executed on the same day or for conviction of the same crime;
            anonymous individuals executed, such as a “slave woman” or “pirate man;” city, county,
            state, or regional records and histories, and lists of individuals executed; and
            unconfirmed or possible executions. At the end of this subseries are files with lists or
            records of individuals executed from multiple states. For instance, a list of juveniles
            or innocents executed from more than one state or executions from other states listed in
            Maryland newspapers.</p>
          <p>The federal, military and Native American tribal subseries follow the same arrangement
            scheme. The files are organized alphabetically by the last name of the individual
            executed when one or two people received the death penalty. Following are files
            containing references to multiple executions, lists of individuals executed, and then
            unconfirmed executions.</p>
          <p>The international subseries is arranged alphabetically by country and then by an
            individual’s last name. There are less than fifteen countries and one U.S. territory
            mentioned.</p>

          <p>This series features administrative records of Watt Espy’s efforts to chronicle every
            government-sanctioned execution in the United States as part of his Capital Punishment
            Research Project. Espy was the only full-time employee of this organization although he
            worked with paid graduate assistants while at the University of Alabama School of
            Law.</p>
          <p>Through correspondence, this series recounts Espy’s work at the university, including
            the tribulations of his work on the National Science Foundation grant to produce a
            dataset of executions in the United States and relations with his academic partner on
            the grant. Espy writes often of his difficulties with the dataset, outlining errors
            committed by others during the data entry process, such as using the wrong code for type
            of execution, misspelling prisoner names, and typing in incorrect dates. There are
            numerous computer printouts of the dataset.</p>
          <p>The series also contains Espy’s work from his home in Headland. There are his hard-copy
            and handwritten ledgers listing the executions he researched and their particulars.
            Files document administrative activities, including issuing invoices, paying bills, and
            submitting a copyright registration request. Date books from 1986-1990 and 1995 describe
            research requests, appointments, talks, meetings and telephone conversations.</p>

          <p>The Watt Espy subject files contain a variety of materials that supplement information
            in the other series without necessarily being directly related. Researchers will find
            background information on the history of capital punishment, death penalty statistics,
            and a few files on crime in general. There are folders devoted to crime and punishment
            in many individual states and territories, though not all of them are represented. The
            subject files also contain information on the various methods of execution employed
            across the country, mainly hanging, gassing, electrocution, and lethal injection.
            Additionally, there are death penalty-related topics such as physician participation,
            editorial pieces dealing with ethics of capital punishment, execution of prisoners with
            low IQs, background materials on the death penalty in early America, and a few assorted
            death penalty research projects that Espy followed. There are also assorted photos, many
            of which feature inmates and prisons. Images of identified and unidentified individuals
            executed are presumed to be the ones that filled the walls of Espy’s house.</p>
          <p>The subject files mainly are comprised of secondary source materials collected by Espy
            by virtue of his interest in the topics or actively used by him in his research.
            Occasionally there are entire photocopied books, or chapters of books, which have been
            retained due to the age and/or scarcity of the originals from which they were taken. </p>
          <p>Many folders have items dated in the 1950s and earlier, some even to the 1800s, but
            those dates reflect the age of the content, not the documents themselves. Most of the
            papers in the subject files are photocopies obtained by Espy from the 1970s to the
            1990s. Also, please note that the date spans in this series are not inclusive.</p>

          <p>Watt Espy sent and received a significant amount of correspondence as part of his work
            on the Capital Punishment Research Project. The majority of correspondence, however, was
            not organized when it arrived at the University at Albany. The archivists elected to
            arrange it into two groups: files devoted to prominent or regular correspondents, and
            general correspondence. The former includes key academics (Michael Radelet, Hugo Bedeau,
            Margaret Vandiver), attorneys (The California Appellate Project, NAACP Legal Defense and
            Educational Fund, Ohio Public Defender’s Office), death penalty abolitionists and
            advocacy group executives (Rev. Joe Ingle, Sister Helen Prejean, Henry Schwarzschild),
            prominent prisoners and their families (Kerry Max Cook, Gary McGivern), and researchers
            who frequently corresponded with Espy. There were also a small number of files that Espy
            organized by subject, such as letters to and from prisoners, telephone inquiries, or
            correspondence relating to executions in a particular state, and the archivists retained
            this order and kept the files in the first group. The second group includes more
            infrequent correspondents, usually general inquiries sent to libraries or archives for
            records relating to individuals executed or for research requests.</p>
          <p>Please see Series 3: Capital Punishment Research Project for correspondence
            specifically relating to Espy’s work at the University of Alabama School of Law and the
            National Science Foundation grant and Series 6: Biographical Materials for
            correspondence related to some of Espy’s publications, testimony, speaking events, and
            signed portrait and autograph collection.</p>

          <p>This series contains materials about Watt Espy, including his speeches, published and
            unpublished writings, testimony, portraits, and news clips featuring Espy or quoting
            him. Of interest are files relating to his unpublished manuscript on juvenile executions
            and to a small signed portrait and autograph collection, mainly featuring members of the
            United States Congress. In addition, there are several personal items of Espy’s: his
            typewriter, which he utilized well into the 1990s, his eyeglasses, his hat, and a
            special award from the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty from 1991.</p>

          <p>Watt Espy amassed materials related to a variety of organizations advocating against
            capital punishment, for better prison conditions, for human rights, and for an improved
            and unbiased criminal justice system. The groups vary and may be secular or religious,
            national, statewide or local. Materials in this series include newsletters, execution
            alerts, appeals, meeting minutes, and brochures. In some instances, it is possible to
            determine that Espy was active within or supported a particular organization as his name
            appears in meeting minutes or related papers.</p>

          <p>For over thirty years, Watt Espy assembled true crime, penitentiary, detective, western
            U.S. life and culture, and legal publications containing articles about capital crimes,
            executions, and criminal profiles. The publications date from the 1930s into the 21st
            Century. While some present straightforward non-fiction explanations of crimes, others
            feature more sensational accounts with lurid depictions. Of interest are 30 issues of
            the award-winning <title><emph render="italic">The Angolite</emph></title>, a
            newsmagazine written by prisoners at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. This series also
            includes more than a half dozen Death Row annuals, featuring profiles and photographs of
            condemned prisoners, and a set of serial killer, mass murderer and gangster trading
            cards. Please note that Espy personally bound the publications in boxes 88-90, but did not include all issues for each year in the bound volume.  Therefore some publications have both bound and unbound issues. </p>
