      <p>Samuel B. Gould donated his papers in 1988 to the M.E. Grenander Department of Special
        Collections and Archives. When Dr. Gould passed away in 1997, his children gave some of his
        personal materials to Dr. Martin Fausold who was researching both the history of the State
        University of New York and Dr. Gould. Fausold later donated these materials along with his
        own papers in 2008.</p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Samuel Brookner Gould was an American educator known for promoting expanded access to
        education through the use of non-traditional means, such as educational television, college
        teacher-mentor systems, and universities without walls. Among his most important positions
        were the presidency of the Educational Broadcasting System (1962-64); the Chancellorship of
        the State University of New York (1964-70); and the chairman of the Carnegie Commission on
        Non-Traditional Study (1971-74).</p>
      <p>Samuel Gould was born in Shelton, Connecticut, on October 11, 1910. At the age of 16 he
        attended Bates College in Maine, where he was a general assistant to the president. He
        graduated in 1930. He attended Oxford University briefly in 1931 but left due to financial
        difficulties. Gould worked for New England Telephone and Telegraph until he accepted a
        teaching position in English at William Hall High School in West Hartford, Connecticut
        (1932-38). He also worked part time for a radio station. In 1936, he married Laura Johanna
        Ohmen, a native of Finland. From 1938 to 1947, Gould headed the department of speech at
        Brookline High School in Massachusetts while working on his Ph.D. from Harvard. He had
        previously completed his M.A. at New York University.</p>
      <p>Gould's doctoral work was interrupted by World War II. He served in the Navy as a Lt.
        Commander, PTD, gaining honors. After the war, he helped establish Boston University's
        Communications Department and served as an assistant to the president from 1951 to 1953. In
        1954, Gould became president of Antioch College in Ohio, a position he held until he was
        appointed chancellor of the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1959. UCSB expanded
        its academic program under his leadership. In July of 1962, Gould became president of the
        Educational Broadcasting System in New York with the flagship station, WNDT-TV, channel
        13.</p>
      <p>In 1964, Gould was appointed chancellor of the State University of New York (SUNY). During
        his administration, SUNY underwent its greatest physical and academic expansion and
        consolidation. Gould's vision for SUNY went beyond a desire to establish a traditional
        university system. He included in the university system new technologies such as television
        and non-traditional study opportunities such as those provided by the Empire State College
        teacher-mentor system. Under his tenure, the concept of granting academic credit for
        non-academic experience was initiated.</p>
      <p>In 1970, Gould retired from SUNY, became Chancellor Emeritus and served briefly as a
        director at McKinsey and Company. From 1971 to 1974, he served as the chairman of the
        Carnegie Commission on Non-Traditional Study which attempted to modify and set new goals for
        education. During the 1970s Gould worked periodically with the Venezuelan Ministry of
        Education in developing that nation's university system. He accompanied former United States
        Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, a close personal friend, on his 1977 tour of Latin
        America. From 1976 to 1977, he served as interim chancellor for higher education for the
        State of Connecticut. He has also served as a trustee of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity
        Association and on the Commission for Post-Secondary Educational Planning in Florida.</p>
      <p>Gould died on June 11, 1997. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Samuel B. Gould Papers document's his long career in the field of higher education.
        This collection is divided into four series arranged chronologically: Biographical Material,
        Speeches, Reports and Published and Unpublished Works, and Administrative Files.</p>
      <p>The Biographical Material series generally contains news and magazine clippings reporting
        events of Gould's life, particularly his tenure as chancellor at SUNY. There are also some
        articles on Gould's wife and two interviews with Gould as well as pictures of Laura Gould's
        paintings. This series also contains personal and professional photographs and Gould's naval
        orders and assignments.</p>
      <p>By far the most extensive element in the papers are Gould's speeches, which cover the
        period of his presidency at Antioch College through his retirement. Speeches were Gould's
        primary means of communicating his ideas and views. Many of the speeches are repeated, with
        modifications for the audience and event, a process that was assisted by a 1969 condensed
        version of his ideas on education compiled by his SUNY staff. His speeches discuss trends in
        educational techniques and philosophies, including developments in non-traditional
        approaches and the use of electronic media. These also document the development of his
        programs for expansion at Antioch College, the University of California at Santa Barbara,
        the Educational Broadcasting System, the State University of New York, and the Carnegie
        Commission on Non-Traditional Study. The researcher should note that each speech's title is
        proceeded by the institution in which Gould served at the time of the speech.</p>
      <p>Samuel Gould's reports, published articles and books are generally extensions of ideas
        previously expressed in his speeches and lectures. The third series contains many published
        and unpublished works of Gould's, including his unpublished autobiography <emph render="italic">A Maverick in the Establishment</emph>. Some folders contain
        correspondence about publishing articles and book reviews, as well as requests for
        re-print.</p>
      <p>The last series, Administrative Files, contains materials from Gould's administrative
        roles, such as memorandums and press releases.</p>

            Educational and Cultural Affairs (1961), president of the Educational Broadcasting
            Corporation (1962), chancellor of SUNY (1964-70), and chairman of the Commission on
            Non-Traditional Study (1973), relating to his interest in educational reform. The series
            includes a summary of publicly expressed ideas with a bibliography and listing of
            speeches. Also included is a carbon copy of an unpublished monograph entitled "The
            Emerging Role of Management in Higher Education" (ca. 1952). The series also contains
            three books on the subject of educational reform. Two were written by Gould, <emph render="italic">Knowledge is Not Enough</emph> (1959) and <emph render="italic">Today's Academic Condition</emph> (1970), and one, <emph render="italic">Diversity By
              Design</emph> (1975), was written jointly by the Commission on Non-Traditional Study.
            Gould wrote the preface to this book. This series contains correspondence between Gould
            and his publishers on the publication of his books, requests from editors of journals
            and magazines for permission to publish his writings, and a few letters from friends of
            Gould and his wife requesting copies of publications.</p>
