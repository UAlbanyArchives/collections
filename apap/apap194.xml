    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The North American Fiddler's Hall of Fame was created in 1973 in the Central New York area. What started out as a picnic, eventually grew into a permanent settlement in Osceola, Lewis County, New York in 1975. By 1976, the New York Old Tyme Fiddlers' Association (NYSOTFA) and the North American Fiddlers' Hall of Fame and Museum Institute was officially formed as a non-proft 501 (c)(3).  Every last full weekend in July, the NYSOFTA holds its annual Fiddlers' Picnic. </p><p>The NYSOTFA purchased a Museum site in 1981, where they have exhibits and historical artifacts. In 1994, the NYSOTFA purchased a pole barn to hold free Sunday concerts during the summer. The stage, now called "The Fiddlers Pavilion," includes a dance floor and brick patio. The NYSOTFA continues to host events for all age groups in Osceola, New York.   </p>  </bioghist>
