    <abstract id="aspace_3da4509f5c51c7be7f0cc98f84324f08">This collection contains documents, materials, and memorabilia spanning the life and career of former New York Attorney General Nathaniel L. Goldstein, who served the state from 1943 to 1954. Goldstein, a Republican, is largely remembered for his work to delegitimize the Ku Klux Klan and contributions to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (once part of Yeshiva University), as well as other facets of American security, philanthropy, and Jewish life in the mid-20th century. After his time in office, Goldstein continued his lifelong love of litigation by working in a private law firm.</abstract>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The Nathaniel L. Goldstein Papers were first processed by Syracuse University in the mid-1960s following Goldstein's donation in 1963-1964. By modern archival standards, it was overprocessed, with individual folders being recognized as a series. Extra material was sent to Syracuse University in 1968-1969 and 1971-1973, but was never interfiled. The M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives has interfiled the newer material arranged all items, including filed materials, oversized documents and books and scrapbooks, alphabetically.</p>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Nathaniel Lawerence Goldstein was born June 9, 1896 in Kings County, Brooklyn, New York City. In 1915 he received a Bachelor of Commercial Science from New York University and a Bachelor of Law in 1918 from New York Law School. He was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi throughout, and after graduation served in the United States Army during World War I. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Syracuse University in 1948, Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1952, and New York Law School in 1957. Upon his return from the military, Goldstein worked as an accountant and eventually began to practice law with Brooklyn Assemblyman Charles C. Lockwood.</p>

<p>Goldstein was admitted to the New York Bar in 1918. He became a C.P.A. in 1919. From 1940-1942, he was the assistant chief counsel to the Director of Selective Service in New York. Goldstein was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1940, 1944, and 1948 and the people of New York elected him as their state Attorney General in 1942, 1946, and 1950. Goldstein spent much of his time as attorney general dealing with rent-control litigation, the drugs epidemic, and financial crime. Goldstein also aimed to withdraw the New York State charter for the Ku Klux Klan, and was able to give the FBI 1,100 names of members of the Ku Klux Klan and the Hitler-resurgent German American Bund. Following his retirement in 1954 from the Attorney General's office, he became a member of the law firm of Goldstein, Judd, and Gurfein.</p>

<p>Goldstein had many and varied organizational interests and was active in the Jewish community of New York City. He was a member of the United Palestine Appeal. He also served as a director and vice-president of the Wilkie Memorial of Freedom House, a trustee of the New York Law School, and chairman emeritus of the Board of Overseers of Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, proving his sincere interest in higher education. He was a member of the American Bar Association, Zionist Organization of America, American Legion, Freemasons, B'nai B'rith, and Elks and acted as special counsel for the law firm Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, and Underbreg. Among his other activities he was the Associate Chairmanship of the United Jewish Appeal, held membership in the United States delegation to the United Nation's Narcotic Drug Control Commission, and past post commander in the American Legion. He also contributed many articles to various legal publications.</p>

<p>Goldstein died in Manhattan in 1981 and was survived by his wife Etta May Brown and his children Lois Lowenstein and Steven Goldstein.</p>   </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Nathaniel L. Goldstein Papers contain filed materials which document Goldstein's life and career. This includes correspondence, photographs, speeches, small publications, even birthday and greeting cards. The scrapbooks comprise a signficant portion of the collection. There are over 27 in total, but only half are stable enough for researchers to view. These scrapbooks do not hold photographs but rather a litany of newspaper clippings and typed documents, mostly speeches, by or about Goldstein and relating to his career. The paper backing of most of these scrapbooks is of poor quality and now fragile, the newsprint has become brittle with time, and the adhesives (glue, tape) used to hold the papers and clippings in place have failed. The scrapbooks have been unbound and placed individually in oversized boxes. All scrapbooks are very dusty, and researchers are advised to wear a face mask when handling them.</p>

<p>Please note that while there may be speeches or newspaper clippings in the scrapbooks that refer to Goldstein's efforts to  combat the Ku Klux Klan and the German American Bund, there is no correspondence, reports or other foldered materials documenting this work in the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
