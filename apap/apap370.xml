    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>This collection includes newsletters, fiscal materials, minutes and agendas, conference materials, administrative materials, correspondence, organization case studies, physical materials, audio-visual materials, screening tools, position papers, legal counsil, legislative lobbying materials, member resource materials, presidential record materials, event planning materials, reports and announcements, and organization history materials.</p><p>This collection pertains primarily to records following the consolidation of School Psychologists of Upstate New York, SPUNY, and the New York Association of School Psychologists, NYASP. This consolidation of the two organizations into the New York Association of School Psychologists, NYASP, occurred between 1981 and 1983. While there are some records from this earlier period, they are few in number and primarily pertain to newsletters, member resources, correspondences, and announcements rather than daily operations, and activities.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The New York Association of School Psychologists (NYASP) is the organization which represents school psychologists throughout the State.  It is divided into  geographic chapters, each of which holds local meetings, often with presenters on current issues in the field.  As a statewide organization it also holds an annual two and a half day conference.  The organization employs a legislative consultant to remain abreast of pending legislation which has an impact upon children, families and schools, and it holds an annual lobby day to meet with senators and assemblypersons.  The NYASP publishes a newsletter three or four times a year. </p><p>Until 1983 there were two school psychology associations in New York State.  NYASP covered the downstate area and the School Psychologists of Upstate New York, SPUNY, covered the remainder. The two organizations then merged into one association, NYASP, in 1983.</p>  </bioghist>
