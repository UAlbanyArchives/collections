    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The New York Association of School Psychologists (NYASP) is the organization which represents school psychologists throughout the State.  It is divided into  geographic chapters, each of which holds local meetings, often with presenters on current issues in the field.  As a statewide organization it also holds an annual two and a half day conference.  The organization employs a legislative consultant to remain abreast of pending legislation which has an impact upon children, families and schools, and it holds an annual lobby day to meet with senators and assemblypersons.  The NYASP publishes a newsletter three times a year. </p><p>Until 1983 there were two school psychology associations in New York State.  NYASP covered the downstate area and the School Psychologists of Upstate New York covered the remainder.  The two organizations then merged into one association, NYASP, in 1983.</p>  </bioghist>
