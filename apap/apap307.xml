    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Michael Robert McNulty was a U.S. Representative from New York. A Democrat, he represented New Yorks 21st Congressional District (which encompasses Albany, Schenectady and Troy as well as portions of Fulton, Montgomery and Schoharie Counties) from 1989 to 2009. McNulty was born in Troy in 1947 and graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA in 1969. He served as town supervisor of Green Island, N.Y. from 1969 to 1977 and as mayor from 1977 to 1983. That year he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he served until 1988. When Congressman Samuel Stratton withdrew from the 1988 Congressional race, McNulty replaced him as the Democratic candidate and was elected. He served in Congress for ten terms and was a member of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee, where he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security. He chose not to run for reelection in 2008.</p>  </bioghist>
