    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jeffrey Walsh, 1960-2020, was born in Canton, Ohio. After graduation from high school, he served in the United States Navy for four years. He then earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Wyoming. </p><p>Walsh was an investigator for the Capital Habeas Unit of the federal government. He also owned Capital Defense Project in Tallahassee, Florida. This organization specialized in criminal defense investigations both during trial and post-conviction, witness location, mitigation, and fact development. </p><p>In Florida, Walsh investigated the case of Frank Lee Smith, ultimately helping to overturn Smith's conviction. In 1986, Smith was convicted of the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl. Smith spent 14 years on Death Row. In December 2000, 11 months after Smith's death from cancer, Smith was posthumously exonerated after exculpatory DNA testing results cleared him of the crime and identified the actual perpetrator.</p><p>Walsh was survived by his mother, sister, two brothers, and many nieces and nephews.</p>  </bioghist>
