    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>BirthNet is a birth justice organization founded in 2001 that serves the Albany, New York area, including the communitities of Troy, Schenectady, Rensselaer, Latham, Colonie, Saratoga, and East and North Greenbush. BirthNet's mission is to ensure that all families receive respectful and appropriate maternity and infant care and to eradicate the inequities in birth outcomes for all childbearing people and birthing situations caused by healthcare discrimination. BirthNet is an advocacy organization that connects people with supportive resources, community events, and doula services in the Capital Region of New York. BirthNet envisions a community that is centered on personalized care that is culturally appropriate and results in optimal health outcomes. Maternal mortality rates and the prevention of pregnancy-related death is a key concern for BirthNet. BirthNet intends to push back against the historically racist gynecological profession and empower BIPOC individuals through their programs. Access to education and tools to promote positive birthing experiences regardless of size, gender, sexuality, orientation, and family or cultural structure is encouraged by the organization. BirthNet began working on Birth Justice initiatives in Albany in 2017 to address healthcare disparities. In 2019, BirthNet held the first doula training program in the Capital District.</p>  </bioghist>
