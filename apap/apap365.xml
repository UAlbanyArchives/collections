    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Established in 1982, Holding Our Own's supports feminist social justice. A multiracial, multicultural philanthropic foundation led by women of color, Holding Our Own, Inc. awards grants to organizations and projects in New York's Capital Region which benefit women. Special attention is given to grassroots organizations and those which represent women who face bias or have limited access to traditional funding sources. Past grants included funding of reading groups for children of color, a recreation project for women with AIDS/HIV, carpentry training for battered women, and a cooperative tutoring project involving a public housing tenant group and a local college.</p>  </bioghist>
