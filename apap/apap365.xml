    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Established in 1982 and existing for nearly four decades, Holding Our Own supported feminist social justice. A multiracial, multicultural philanthropic foundation led by women of color, Holding Our Own, Inc. awarded grants to organizations and projects in New York's Capital Region which benefitted women. Special attention was given to grassroots organizations and those which represented women who faced bias or had limited access to traditional funding sources. This included funding of reading groups for children of color, a recreation project for women with AIDS/HIV, carpentry training for battered women, and a cooperative tutoring project involving a public housing tenant group and a local college. Holding Our Own also partnered with the Women's Building Project to fund and provide access to services and programs improving the quality of life for women and girls in the Albany area. When choosing organizations and programs to fund, Holding Our Own prioritized intersectional projects that served all women regardless of race, sexuality, age, ability, ethnicity, religion, education or class.</p>  </bioghist>
