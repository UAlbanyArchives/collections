    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Formally established in 1929 with 15 women as charter members, the Zonta Club of Albany has been a service organization for nearly a century in New York's Capital District. The first president of the Club was Christine Birrell Kimball, a public relations consultant. The Zonta Club of Albany is part of Zonta International, founded in 1919 in Buffalo, New York, which today has clubs in more than 60 countries worldwide. </p><p>Throughout its history, the Zonta Club of Albany has engaged in outreach, conducted fundraising, volunteered, and implemented projects to benefit Capital District women and girls. These efforts have included the building of an interfaith chapel at Memorial Hospital in Albany, contributing toward the formation of Albany Girls Club, and supporting such local programs and organizations as Mercy House, The Next Step, Inc., Albany Medical Center, Albany County Jail Women's Project, the Capital City Rescue Mission's Women and Children's Center, the Equinox Domestic Violence Shelter, and many more.</p><p>The Zonta Club of Albany also was instrumental in the establishment of other local Zonta clubs including ones in the Troy area, Montgomery/Fulton, Columbia/Greene area, and Kingston.</p>  </bioghist>
