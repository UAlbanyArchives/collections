    <head>Organizational History</head>
<p>Established in 1987 by children's music performers, the Children's Music Network has its roots in the People's Music Network. The organization believed that music could help children better understand,  think about, and use their voices to express their views about challenging global issues like the environment, war, discrimination and bigotry. Early supporters were children's music performers but also teachers, radio hosts, parents, and songwriters. In its first year, the organization began publishing a newsletter, Pass It On!, and held its first gathering, separate from a People's Music Network conference.</p><p>Today, the Children's Music Network continues its work to educate, build community and empower children through quality and multicultural music. The organization is a nonprofit with members in chapters across the United States and Canada. Members include full-time and part-time performers, songwriters, classroom teachers, music educators, librarians, storytellers, record producers, distributors, broadcasters, parents, grandparents, and children. An international annual conference along with regional and local gatherings continue to be held. </p>  </bioghist>
