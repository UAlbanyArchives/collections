    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The New York State Wetlands Forum is a non-advocacy not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to provide a politically neutral venue for the discussion of issues regarding wetlands in New York State by all relevant parties, including scientists, policy-makers, developers, and property-rights activists. Wetlands are ecosystems intermediate in nature between dry land and open water, such as swamps, bogs, marshes and vernal pools, where there is standing water for at least part of the year, the soils are poorly drained, and the plants are adapted to go without oxygen for extended periods of time. First founded as the New York Wetlands Coalition in 1988, the organization changed its name to the New York State Wetlands Forum in September 1993. Its mission statement declares that it is the task of the group to "improve communication among people interested in wetlands; call attention to and objectively discuss local, statewide, regional, national and global wetland issues as they relate to New York State; improve its members' knowledge and understanding of wetlands; and make available information about wetlands to its members and the general public." Membership is open to the public, and types of members include attorneys, engineers, government officials, and scientists, according to the website New York State Wetlands Forum.</p><p> The principal activities of the New York State Wetlands Forum include publishing a bi-annual newsletter, <emph render="italic">The Forum</emph>, tracking changes in state and federal wetlands regulations, communicating new wetlands research, and sponsoring conferences on wetlands. The organization is run by a ten-member Board of Governors, which consists of five officers, the chair, first vice-chair, second vice-chair, treasurer, and secretary, and five at-large members. There have been five chairs: Norbert Quenzer Jr. (1994-1996), Sally Daly (1996-1998), Barbara B. Beall (1998-2000), Jennifer Brady-Connor (2000-2002), and Christine Delorier (2002-Present).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains the records of the New York State Wetlands Forum from its establishment under that name in September 1993 up to early 2002. The records loaned to the M. E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives for photocopying were originally housed in an administrative binder. Materials include by-laws, a certificate of incorporation, minutes of Board of Governors and general membership meetings, conference schedules (in the meetings folder), and issues of <emph render="italic">The Forum</emph> from 1996 to 2002 (volumes three to nine, with volumes three, four, five, and nine each missing one issue). The minutes document primarily the internal operations of <emph render="italic">The Forum</emph>, and most actual wetlands-related information is found in the newsletters. A recurring theme in the "message from the chair" column in each issue is the need for the Forum to maintain neutrality on wetlands issues and to encourage more involvement by business and property-rights advocates. Except for eight of the ten newsletters, the materials in this collection are all photocopies of originals.</p>  </scopecontent>
