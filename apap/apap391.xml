    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Women Against War was formed in 2002 by a network of Capital District New York women who mobilized against the United States government's plan to go to war with Iraq. Their first public event was a gathering that took place on the steps of the Legislative Office Building in Albany on December 5, 2002, where the group put out an open call for participants in their Women's Fast for Peace. The Fast for Peace was ultimately a continuous five-month event where each participant fasted for a twenty four hour period and documented the experience in a shared journal. The group's initial focus was on the cost of the Iraq War to women and children, but, since its inception, Women Against War has expanded their focus through projects and events on Iraqi refugees, Iran, Afghanistan, Korea, the Patriot Act, Islamophobia, and U.S. military spending and recruitment at large. They have become a vital participant in the larger national and international peace and justice movement through their various projects and affiliations, advocating for changed U.S. foreign policies through lobbying, leafletting, billboard and yard sign campaigns, traveling exhibits, vigils, media outreach, and educational events. They have collaborated with other prominent peace organizations, including the American Friends Service Committee and Code Pink. In 2006, a sub-group of Women Against War called Grannies for Peace was established, inspired by the New York City based organization Granny Peace Brigades. Grannies for Peace's first event was a demonstration at the Albany Military Recruiting Office in Colonie Center Mall on February 14, 2006.</p><p>Additional information about the organization can be found on Women Against War's archived website, http://womenagainstwar.org/Archive/index.htm.</p>  </bioghist>
