    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Established in 2002, Women Against War was formed by a group Capital District New York women who mobilized against the United States government's plan to go to war with Iraq. Since then, Women Against War has become a vital participant in the larger national and international peace and justice movement through its various projects and affiliations. Women Against War advocates for changed U.S. foreign policies through lobbying, leafleting, vigils, media outreach, and educational events.</p>  </bioghist>
