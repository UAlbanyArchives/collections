    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The International Typographical Union (ITU) was founded on May 3, 1852 in New York City. The ITU was a US trade union for the printing trade for newspapers and other media.  The original group had 14 cities, that were split up into local unions. The first union was in Indianapolis. THE ITU also had chapters in Canada. To be a member of the union, a person had to be a mailer or a newspaper writer.  The iTU supported a variety of strikes including boycotting the Lost Angeles Times. However, some riots turned violent. On October 1, 1910, James B. Mc Namara, a member of the ITU and his brother placed a bomb in the L.A. Times building. While the brothers were convicted, the L.A> Times remained a non-union shop and continued to not support the ITU. </p><p>Members of the ITU supported an eight-hour work day, and joined other AFL unions during the Great Depression to support organizing. Eventually, due to advancement in technologies, the ITU was not financially stable enough to stand on its own, so members began to try and merge with unions like the Newspaper Guild and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These mergers however, failed and on December 31, 1986 the ITU dissolved.  Members joined the Communication Workers of America.  </p>  </bioghist>
