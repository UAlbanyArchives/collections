    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>ARISE (A Regional Initiative Supporting Empowerment) was a regional organization that sought to unite and revitalize faith and community groups by having them shape public policies; serve as a coalition for social, political, and economic change; and revive New York's Capital District communities. ARISE was established in 1997 as a coalition of Schenectady County churches and community organizations. The following year, the organization expanded to Albany, Rensselaer, and Saratoga Counties thanks to grants from the Catholic Campaign for Human Development and Urban Ministries of the Presbyterian Church (USA). ARISE was open to all faith-based congregations, community groups, neighborhood associations, and membership organizations. It remained active through the 2010s.</p>  </bioghist>
