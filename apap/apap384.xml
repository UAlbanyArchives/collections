    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Capital District Senior Issues Forum began in 1998 as a pilot program focused on senior housing at Albany's Westminster Presbyterian Church.  The Forum moved its headquarters to Catholic Charities in 1999-2000 and established its formal governance structure, which included an all-volunteer member Steering Committee and an Advisory Committee.  The voluntary initiative organization is composed of faith communities, organizations, and individuals. </p><p>Forum members come together to identify and address issues of concern for older seniors in the Capital District of New York, generate support within the faith communities, educate the Capital District about senior needs, and recognize the accomplishments of older seniors.  </p>  </bioghist>
