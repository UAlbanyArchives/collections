    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>CDSIF began as a pilot program in the late 90s focused on senior housing provision. The forum moved its headquarters from Westminster Presbyterian Church to Catholic Charities in 1999-2000 and established formal governance structure, which included an all-volunteer member Steering Committee and an Advisory Committee. The voluntary initiative organization is composed of faith communities, organizations, and individuals. Forum members come together to identify and address issues of concern for older seniors in the Capital District of New York, generate support within the faith communities, educate the Capital District about senior needs, and recognize the accomplishments of older seniors.</p>  </bioghist>
