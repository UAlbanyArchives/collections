    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Archibald C. Wemple campaigned and won the race for mayor of Schenectady, New York in 1951 as the Republican candidate over the incumbent Owen M. Begley. Wemple served as mayor from 1952 through 1955. Wemple was an attorney and past president of the Schenectady Chamber of Commerce at the time of his election. Wemple was originally entered in the Republican primary race for city court judge, but withdrew from that race to accept the party's endorsement for mayor. At the time Wemple said that withdrawing from the city court campaign meant "sacrificing my person ambitions and dreams of becoming city judge, but I'm willing to throw them out the window for the Republican party." This quote was taken from the article, "Executive Group Approves Archibald C. Wemple As GOP Candidate for Mayor," published in the Schenectady Daily Gazette 12 July 1951. A complete list of officials of the City of Schenectady from 1798 to the present is available from the Schenectady County Historical Society at http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/schenectady/officials.html</p>  </bioghist>
