    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Ronald B. Stafford was born in Plattsburgh, NY, on June 29, 1935. He was the adopted child of Agnes and Halsey Stafford, a grade-school teacher and a state prison worker, and was raised in Dannemora, NY. After graduating from Plattsburgh High School, Stafford earned a B.A. in government from St. Lawrence University in 1957. He served in the U.S. Army as an intelligence officer and earned his J.D. from Columbia School of Law in 1962. He was the first St. Lawrence graduate to be awarded an Edward John Noble Fellowship.</p><p> Initially selected by local Republican leaders to run in a special election in 1965, Stafford won his first election to the New York State Senate in 1966. He represented the 45th Senate District in New York State's North Country, which eventually came to include Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Warren, and Washington Counties. Stafford continued to serve the 45th district as State Senator until his retirement in 2002. During his 37-year tenure, Stafford served as Deputy Majority leader for Legislature Operations and as Chairman of several committees including the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Committee on Codes, the Senate Higher Education Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee. While Chairman of the Higher Education Committee in 1974, Stafford helped establish New York State's Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) which provides need-based assistance to many undergraduate students who would otherwise be financially unable to attend college</p><p> Senator Stafford was instrumental in bringing the Winter Olympic Games to Lake Placid in 1980, having been appointed Chairman of the New York State 1980 Olympic Winter Games Commission in 1974. He is also noted for his support for the "Toxic Torts Bill," passed in 1986, which expanded legal protection to people exposed to toxic chemicals; Stafford opposed his fellow Republicans during the five-year battle to pass this bill.</p><p> As his district included a significant portion of the Adirondack Park, much of his attention was spent representing the needs of the Park and its residents. Governor George Pataki recognized Senator Stafford "for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the people of the Park" in his keynote address at the Adirondack Park Agency's 30th Anniversary in 2003.</p><p> Stafford served on several boards during his career, including the Boards of Trustees of the College of St. Rose and St. Lawrence University and the Boards of Directors of the Champlain Valley School of Nursing and the Adirondack Council of the Boy Scouts of America. After his retirement, Governor Pataki appointed him to the Board of Trustees for the State University of New York. Senator Stafford's family included his wife, the former Kay McCabe, two sons, a daughter, a stepson, a stepdaughter, and four stepgrandchildren. He died on June 24, 2005, after battling lung cancer.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Ronald B. Stafford Papers document Stafford's service as a New York State Senator representing the 45th District. The collection represents the wide range of activities in which Stafford engaged during his 37-year tenure in the State Senate. Stafford's legislative activities are represented by a large amount of material on legislation which he sponsored, co-sponsored and supported. His work on behalf of his North Country constituents is represented by documentation of the casework in which his office solved constituents' problems and by letters of support for grant applications. Appointment books and telephone message pads document Senator Stafford's day-to-day activities, and his public accomplishments are recorded in news clippings and press releases. His activities as representative of the Adirondack region are described in series on the Adirondack Park Agency and the Lake Placid Olympics. Senator Stafford's career is further documented by photographs, memorabilia and physical artifacts acquired during his long service in the State Senate.</p>  </scopecontent>

committees created to prepare for and host the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Such groups include the Lake Placid Olympic Bid Committee, the Temporary State XIII Olympic Winter Games Commission, and the New York State 1980 Lake Placid Olympic Winter Games Commission. Materials represented include reports, correspondence, appointments, memoranda, minutes, finances, and clippings. Where the original order identifies the specific committee responsible for a record, this order has been maintained. Many folders, however, contain papers involving the records of more than one committee, and sometimes the specific committee responsible for a record cannot be identified. In these cases, folders are identified with the generic title of "Olympic Winter Games Commissions." In addition, the heading "Olympic Organizing Committee" designates records pertaining to the Lake Placid's 1980 Olympic Winter Games Organizing Committee and its subcommittees, which include Transportation, Security and Public Affairs. This series contains materials used for Lake Plaid's Olympic bid. Proposals and agreements with architects and contractors can also be found in this series as well as Olympic pins, programs, tickets, and employment information.</p></scopecontent><c

and Contents</head><p>This series contains records related to problem-solving activity on behalf of Senator Stafford's constituents. Each year, Senator Stafford's office received numerous letters from constituents asking for help with various problems. A typical case file consists of the constituent's letter, attached supporting material, and notes on the action taken to resolve the problem. The casework for each year is typically grouped under the file name General Casework with larger cases belonging in their own, separate folder. Cases are arranged chronologically by year.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_3c28bdf50010662545e775e621c52ef6" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Casework</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1976/1978" type="inclusive">1976-1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_986091e8b68b7b4ec0ac85901dfd5726" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_4d97ef3fed4d115540eb869575d296bc" parent="aspace_986091e8b68b7b4ec0ac85901dfd5726" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a84b35e480e1a0d669da0a3591c46f58" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pending Casework</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1977/1977" type="inclusive">1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_9c13543842a10b79f82e5f34907bc1e2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_e30bbf8e679297a6353d32078c502ea5" parent="aspace_9c13543842a10b79f82e5f34907bc1e2" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_aa3cd4478e75093bbd51119d73514527" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meyer, Norman - Estate Case</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1983/1983" type="inclusive">1983</unitdate><container id="aspace_0de719d9630567c67f263e7eac784875" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_d26349d7f71a16078c66859f059f02ec" parent="aspace_0de719d9630567c67f263e7eac784875" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e384a6efb47e8af909ab4a358fe5aa65" level="file"><did><unittitle>Washington County Solid Waste Incinerator</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1987/1987" type="inclusive">1987</unitdate><container id="aspace_ee7c37ee0e557c04ab757825991ec88f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_b174360504175657302c87aeba5d5022" parent="aspace_ee7c37ee0e557c04ab757825991ec88f" type="Folder">4-5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_24bf56202d0c77fe51ce6f38785033d2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Blue Cross/Blue Shield - Northeastern New York Hospitals</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1990/1990" type="inclusive">1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_2694de9e06238114d57755fef867e545" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_ce532a24c2e808142985cbd4f3371041" parent="aspace_2694de9e06238114d57755fef867e545" type="Folder">6-7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ec9aba8ea122b5df80a940ea4cb768c9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lifeguard Issue - Background Material</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_15720011076a3a43a1d84b2ae0e78b5e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_98238f13a3fdbef9c2a17fda6fbbfc89" parent="aspace_15720011076a3a43a1d84b2ae0e78b5e" type="Folder">8-9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f2e124726e68a9a6b02fe7206abcd159" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Casework</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1992/1993" type="inclusive">1992-1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_2bb9c5ecf77ed7d78fcd0baaa287a2d7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (4-Casework)</container><container id="aspace_b86592a64bc5dc8929a25f32a649c2b7" parent="aspace_2bb9c5ecf77ed7d78fcd0baaa287a2d7" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_500ed2b1c3b127cba8694dd0a77fccac" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lifeguard Issue, Department of Health v.

into two subseries in order to preserve original order. The first subseries is arranged alphabetically. In the late 1990s, it appears that Senator Stafford's office changed the way it organized his correspondence. Subseries 2 reflects this change in organization. The researcher should also note that the files in Subseries 2 are arranged according to specific dates. It is possible that the switch came about when the Senator's staff switched to a new computerized form letter system that stored letters chronologically by their date of creation.</p></scopecontent><c

Stafford was a sponsor, co-sponsor or supporter. Files typically contain a final print of the bill and may contain drafts and previous versions, supporting material, and other material records to the bill. A majority of the files contain a copy of the final bill and a memorandum of support. Bills that faced public debate are in larger files, containing letters of support, letters of opposition, correspondence, and multiple drafts. A pattern can be seen within the legislation files pertaining to the issues Senator Stafford cared about. The same bill can be seen throughout multiple years, slightly changing in hopes to have it passed. The bill eventually stops appearing, signifying that it was either passed, or Senator Stafford decided not to pursue it again. The researcher should note that the full name of the bill is used as the file name from approximately 1974-1980. After that, the files are named in accordance with Stafford's naming scheme by the main theme or topic of the legislative bill. These themes and topics include the following: the Adirondack Park Agency, Fishing and Hunting Licenses, Environmental Issues, Retirement Membership and Services, and Higher Education. This series also contains legislative resolutions that Senator Stafford either introduced or supported. These were often to honor, memorialize, or congratulate people or events. Files are organized chronologically.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_b8fb3d18b6016f7c883cc66fa27172db" level="file"><did><unittitle>Allow Students to Pray in Empty Classrooms Before and After
