    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>A partner of the law firm of Hyman &amp; Harris, William Abramowitz Hyman was born on July 29, 1893 in Baltimore. Hyman spent his boyhood in Florida, attending St. Josephs Parochial School, Tampa, then working his way through Washington and Lee University and Columbia University School of Law. In 1916, Hyman went to work for Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., starting his own law firm in 1929. Under Governor Alfred E. Smith Hyman served as special deputy attorney general of New York. Hyman is best known for his legal theories on the use of space which he propounded in his 1961 book, The Magna Carta of Space. In 1964 Hyman lead a legal crusade against the unauthorized use by physicians and scientists of elderly, indigent, and chronically ill people for experimental purposes without their consent. Patients had been injected with live cancer viruses. He argued the case before the State Court of Appeals. This fight won him the Certificate of Honor from the National Health Federation as a champion of human rights and defender of the dignity of man. Hyman died on July 10, 1966.</p>  </bioghist>
