    <abstract id="aspace_7c0186a1a34daff53061aea1b66f0fdc">The records of the League of Women Voters of Albany County (LWVAC), include material produced by the LWVAC as well as material that was produced by the League of Women Voters of New York State and the League of Women Voters of the United States. The most comprehensive series in the collection is the Administrative Files. There are meeting minutes, annual reports, and Board of Directors lists from 1940-2001. A large portion of the LWVAC collection relates to the two main purposes of the organization: voter service and "study and action." Records relating to voter service include pamphlets with information about candidates and citizen voting rights published by the LWVAC and material used to increase voter participation. Records related to "study and action" include material used by the LWVAC to inform citizens about public policy issues locally, statewide, and nationally. A strength of the LWVAC collection is the amount of material related to various public policy issues and how they affected the local community.</abstract>

    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The League of Women Voters (LWV) has been informing citizens about, encouraging their participation with, and lobbying for national, state, and local political issues for over eighty years. Carrie Chapman Catt founded the League in 1920 during the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Six months later women across the nation were given the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution. Following ratification the League of Women Voters took up the responsibility of helping 20 million women carry out their new power to participate in shaping public policy.</p><p> The founders believed the League should take on a nonpartisan status so members of the League, as well as citizens, could participate in shaping public policy without getting involved in party politics. Being a nonpartisan political organization allows the League of Women Voters to work on issues of concern to members and the public at the national, state, and local levels. Within state and local affiliate organizations League members encourage the informed and active participation of citizens in government, help to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influence public policy through education and advocacy. The branches of the national organization into local communities made the LWV "an every woman's organization".</p><p> Women in New York State, enfranchised in 1917, created the League of Women Voters of New York State (LWVNYS) in 1919. In Albany County, according to local league history (records from this time period have been lost), an organization called the City Club, created in 1920, provided a means "for better citizenship" for the area's women and perhaps temporarily negated the demand for a local League. At the 1921 annual convention of LWVNYS, held in the city of Albany, the attendance of local women suggested there was in fact a need for a League in the Capital District. Women of the Albany area pledged money to support the State League as a group and held a meeting on March 6, 1922 to raise a sum of $150 to be sent to the LWVNYS. Women throughout Albany County attended this meeting and the League of Women Voters of Albany County (LWVAC) was formed.</p><p> According to the organization's by-laws, the purpose of the LWVAC is to "promote political responsibility through informed and active participation of citizens in government". To achieve this purpose the LWVAC is charged with "[taking] action of local governmental measure and policies in the public interest in conformity with the principles of the League of Women Voters of the United States" and "shall not support or oppose any political party or any candidate".</p><p> In accordance with the organization of the LWVNYS Albany County became a subdivision of the state League with a county chair. The county was further divided into assembly districts with a chair for each district. The first chair of the Albany County League was Mrs. Charles L. A. Whitney. Under the leadership of Mrs. Whitney the LWVAC immediately acted on its stated purpose and provided non-partisan voter services to the citizens of Albany County and informed the people on political questions.</p><p> By the end of its first decade of service the LWVAC had around fifty members. The League's activity was focused on, but not limited to, providing voter service. This involved educating citizens about voter registration, election law, primaries, elections, and amendments. The League also sought to increase voter participation within Albany County. In addition to voter service, members of the local League participated in monthly meetings, study groups, and a number of committees. The committees studied and took action on issues including the legal status of women, education, and public welfare. Within the next ten years membership of the LWVAC increased to seventy-five members; the head of the organization's designation was changed from "chairman" to "president"; and the action committees were increased to include international relations, labor relations, operation of government, and social welfare. The LWVAC was also encouraged to adopt local programs of study.</p><p> As the League grew in members its efforts to educate the public increased as well. For example, the LWVAC informed citizens through articles in the newspapers, radio spots, and television series. In 1951, the organization had a weekly radio series entitled "Spotlight on Government". Two years later the <emph render="italic">Voter's Guide</emph> of Albany County, which outlined the candidates and issues in upcoming elections, was published in a local newspaper and the group had a television series called "Mr. and Mrs. Citizen USA". Beside voter service, the League's action on legislative issues, including trade on the national level and permanent personal registration of voters on a state level, continued in line with the national League and LWVNYS.</p><p> Local program studies at this time included Albany County government. After studying local government, the League published <emph render="italic">Spotlight on Albany County</emph> in 1955. This pamphlet was the first publication to describe the administrative organization of the county, while a subsequent publication, <emph render="italic">This is Albany County</emph>, was published in 1968, 1971, 1980, 1996 and 2000. In 1973 and 1993 the local League supported the revision of the Albany County Charter. In particular, the group advocated for a County Executive in 1973 and making the County Coroner a medical doctor in 1993.</p><p> Other local items of study were mental health and public libraries in the area. The LWVAC began studying mental health facilities in 1955, aided in the creation of the Albany County Mental Health Board in 1958, and continued to take part in the County's mental health services over the years. In 1961, the LWVAC surveyed the library services available to citizens in the county. The group determined that the Town of Colonie was in greatest need of a public library and took part in a door-to-door campaign called Libraries for Albany County Knocking (LACK). In cooperation with 45 other organizations the LWVAC aided in the founding of the Colonie Library Association in November 1961.</p><p> Membership in the LWVAC continued to grow through the 1960s and 1970s as did the League's study and action, voter service, and local programming. The LWVAC was active in preparing the community for the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967 and advocated, along with the LWVNYS, for the defeat of the proposed Constitution. In 1971, the LWVAC included the local school board in its voter service activities. The organization endorsed a non-partisan elected school board for the City of Albany and produced a <emph render="italic">Voter's Guide</emph> for the subsequent election. And, in 1978, the preservation of the Pine Bush reserve became a local program item.</p><p> The local League's dedication to promoting "political responsibility through informed and active participation of citizens in government" is also apparent through their activities in the 1980s and 1990s. Over 1,000 high school students registered to vote at tables set up by the LWVAC in local high schools in 1982. The organization received a $15,000 grant in 1987 from the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation to study and publish <emph render="italic">Household Hazards: A Guide to Detoxifying Your Home</emph>. In 1991, the group organized the Governor's Town Meeting on Universal Health Care. And, in 1996 the LWVAC participated in the national League's Get Out the Vote Campaign by joining other local organizations in the Power the Vote Coalition.</p><p> The LWVAC continues to this day to "educate, participate, [and] advocate". The League, on its own, with other local organizations, and in concert with the LWVNYS and the national LWV, helps citizens to practice their right to vote and encourages participation in shaping public policy.</p><p> Founders</p><p> Mrs. Joseph Gavit</p><p> Mrs. Edmund Huyck</p><p> Mrs. Charles Whitney</p><p> County Chairs</p><p> Mrs. E.V.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection documents the organization and its activities from 1940 to 2001. Although the LWVAC was founded in 1922, the records from the first fifteen to eighteen years of the organization have been lost. Information about the LWVAC during these first years of existence was collected from recollections of the early members and can be found in the 40th Anniversary of the LWVAC pamphlet. From 1940 to 2001, however, the collection is relatively comprehensive. Administrative records including meeting minutes, annual reports, board of directors lists, and membership lists are complete with only a few exceptions. President's correspondence, on the other hand, is very sporadic spread over three decades. Budget and treasurer's reports can be found primarily interfiled with the meeting minutes and annual reports of Series 1, but also grouped together within the same series. Other organizational records of the LWVAC include by-laws and League history.</p><p> The majority of the LWVAC collection relates to the two main purposes of the organization: voter service and "study and action". First, the voter service series contains material related to the League's efforts to educate citizens about their right to vote and increase voter participation. This includes studies of election law and surveys of polling places in Albany County, <emph render="italic">Voter's Guide</emph>s produced by the League explaining the issues and candidates in upcoming elections and other brochures, Speaker's Bureau notes and speeches given to groups on topics of interest to voters, and items dealing with special elections and League sponsored debates. The Study and Action series is made up of items concerning public policy including study material and the LWVAC's position on certain local, state, and national issues. Of local concern was the Albany County government, which is in its own series, and such topics as redistricting and public schools, which are in the Local Program Studies series. Many subjects are well documented from the beginning of study to the point of action and results. However, there are a few topics of interest in this collection for which information about the activities of the LWVAC is lacking, such as the campaign for Libraries for Albany County Knocking and the Equal Rights Amendment.</p><p> The remainder of this collection consists of subject files, publications, memorabilia, and audio-visual material. The subject files include material related to topics that are not associated with voter service or specific LWVAC action on public policy issues. The LWVAC's newsletters, <emph render="italic">The Active Voter</emph> and <emph render="italic">Educate, Participate, Advocate</emph>, are in the series containing printed material. Newsletters from the state and national League as well as publications and bulletins by these organizations can be found here also. Many of the publications in this series were produced by other organizations and collected by the LWVAC for study on topics such as the environment and foreign policy. The audio-visual material is made up of VHS video cassettes and audio cassettes. This small collection contains videos of town meetings and forums sponsored by the LWVAC and audio tapes from the 75th Anniversary Oral History Project of the LWVNYS. Also, the League kept several scrapbooks along with awards and other items related to their activities which can be found in the memorabilia series. The LWVAC collection is a potential resource for information on local voting practices, local issues of public policy, and local reactions to state and national issues of public policy.</p>  </scopecontent>

Voter Service materials include information about the activities the LWVAC took part in such as registering people to vote, participating in poll watching during elections, sponsoring debates and publishing pamphlets with information about candidates and citizens' voting rights. In this series, there are several bulletins on "Voter Service and Election Law", campaign material for the Motor Voter Law in the United States in 1990 and in New York State in 1994, campaign material for Permanent Personal Registration in New York State, and the Get Out the Vote Campaign of 1996. Published material includes <emph render="italic">Voter's Guide</emph>s from various years and <emph render="italic">Your City, County and Political Parties</emph> (no date). Also in this series are papers from the Speaker's Bureau (1961-1990, not inclusive), the LWVAC committee that spoke to other local groups informing them about voting procedures and upcoming elections.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_96e8190618f3495d92b80bc31c96bf65"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and then chronologically</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_2ce8ec3d1dc610f0e0dc303f337ab186" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advocate for the Voter</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1989/1989" type="inclusive">1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_4a0cb62b98ce7f9b1f859edfbc65a862" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4 (2-Voter Service)</container><container id="aspace_3b95d7e81c76abf5239c4a102f266c57" parent="aspace_4a0cb62b98ce7f9b1f859edfbc65a862" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_49bb6aaad022ff48dab04cbb813f6a76" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany City School Board Election, Candidate Questionnaires</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1971/1971" type="inclusive">1971</unitdate><container id="aspace_0727f256832b0a4970346252ee9ad972" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4 (2-Voter Service)</container><container id="aspace_37915354d507060284aa5604f3964431" parent="aspace_0727f256832b0a4970346252ee9ad972" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_60f3764b7e94bc84d22b96ec2ccc38a5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany City School Board Election Study</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1987/1995" type="inclusive">1987-1995</unitdate><container id="aspace_404862d96871384808b8960dbe501f9f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4 (2-Voter Service)</container><container id="aspace_ff6ced9a86a4bef4cfa0eb822f72401c" parent="aspace_404862d96871384808b8960dbe501f9f" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e5bc5c6c726241709c6284fbe453cf4e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany Housing Authority Tennant Commission Election, Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_bd179738014322559f4d58b3bf6b1343" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4 (2-Voter Service)</container><container id="aspace_1118887ee08e63893a5d5b9c4e01eec0" parent="aspace_bd179738014322559f4d58b3bf6b1343" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e7d91ac670c7f3b3116d792eace99635" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany Housing Authority Tennant Commission Election, Election Rules, Volunteer Instructions and Election Materials</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_14dd98c846c36406c79b03a03b3f7d79" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4 (2-Voter Service)</container><container id="aspace_6e5657404f2d6590537d254ab971d56d" parent="aspace_14dd98c846c36406c79b03a03b3f7d79" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5bcf7a8c7aaa2e51ed64fe654928f955" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany Housing Authority Tennant Commission Election, News Clippings</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1976/1978" type="inclusive">1976-1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_a465b01c68e3f3ca4a6d348d4129cfd3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4 (2-Voter Service)</container><container id="aspace_d1fd93dda14f8bc1c7641236a1668bb7" parent="aspace_a465b01c68e3f3ca4a6d348d4129cfd3" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e8c61f8c692ff4a3875ac1567eafcf0e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany County Opportunity, Inc.

The group evaluated such things as the mental health facilities (beginning in 1954), housing (1969 and 1973), and the civic center in Albany County (1984-1985). The Observer Corps (1982-1987), an LWVAC committee, observed meetings of the local governments to monitor compliance of those governments with the New York State Open Meeting Law and Freedom of Information Law following an Open Meeting Survey conducted by the group in 1980. Other local items of study included redistricting the city and county of Albany (1964-1967), solid waste management and the use of the ANSWERS incineration plant (1989-1991), and household hazardous material. From the latter study the LWVAC produced <emph render="italic">Household Hazards: A Guide to Detoxifying Your Home</emph> in 1988 and 1990, which is in this series rather than with publications in

included in this series. The majority of this series is made of material related to the Albany County Charter revision in 1973 and again in 1993. There are Albany County Charter Revision Committee meeting minutes, press releases, and public hearing testimony by members of the LWVAC. The Albany County Legislature was another focus of the LWVAC; the group lobbied for and against certain county issues in the 1970s and 1990s. Also in this series are the guides to Albany County the LWVAC published. <emph render="italic">Spotlight on Albany County</emph> was first published in 1955. The subsequent <emph render="italic">This is Albany County</emph> was published in 1968, 1971, 1980, and 1996.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

on informing citizens about various topics of concern through study and action. This series contains materials related to public policy issues that are broader in scope than the Local Program Studies. The LWVAC takes part in studies and lobbies on a wide range of topics pertaining to the state and national LWV programs. Subjects in this series include state issues such as court reform in New York State (1955-1994), the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1967 and 1997, and Universal Health Care for New York State (1989-1992). National items include International Relations (1954-1998), which concerns United States foreign policy on trade, development assistance, the United Nations, and National Security (1982-1985). The environment and financing education were also topics of study. Materials under the heading "Legislative Action" include calls for action, memos, statements at public hearings, and correspondence to and from legislators relating to items the LWV lobbied for or against (1952-1999). Also in this series are materials on lobbying techniques.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_1396fbbf84b5efb86c196189a7b6c94d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and then

organization of materials collected by the LWVAC that are not related specifically to the functions of administration, voter service, or informing citizens about public policy issues. Included in this series are items from other organizations like the Citizen's Environmental Coalition and the Government Law Center; projects the LWVAC took part in like the Environmental Shopping Program (1990-1991) and Good Government Week (1976); convention materials from the state and national LWV; news clippings; and possible program items. Subjects including records produced by the LWVAC are history and anniversary campaigns, public relations, and sponsorship projects. The LWVAC sponsored women to visit the area for the LWV's Project Demokracia: Building Citizen Participation in Hungary (1994) and Strengthening Women's Rights in the Newly Independent States Internship Program (1995).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_60f194da7c99c5e486083765f64a8a95"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and then chronologically</p></arrangement><c

includes League publications from the local, state, and national organizations. There is also material produced by other organizations that was collected by the LWVAC. There is a relatively comprehensive collection of the LWVAC newsletter <emph render="italic">The Active Voter</emph>, now known as <emph render="italic">Educate, Participate, Advocate</emph>, as well as newsletters from the state and national Leagues. Other publications by the LWVAC such as <emph render="italic">Voter's Guide</emph>s, <emph render="italic">Household Hazards: A Guide to Detoxifying Your Home</emph>, and <emph render="italic">This is Albany County</emph> are included in Series 2, Series 3, and Series 4, respectively. Publications and other material by the state and national LWV include such items as brochures and pamphlets discussing public policy issues and citizen participation and board reports sent to the local Leagues. The series includes material produced by other organizations and is arranged alphabetically by subject. For example, there are a number of items relating to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1967 and financing education. Materials in this part of the series, while not part of a particular study, may have been used as background material for some League studies found within the other series of this collection.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_2b78aa4b35be6598b33f368c41764cc8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically and then chronologically</p></arrangement><c

Contents</head><p>The Photographs and Scrapbooks series includes photographs of LWVAC members and activities and scrapbooks kept by members. Although many of the photographs are unidentified the event at which the photographs were taken can usually be determined. There are many photographs taken during the Strengthening Women's Rights in the Newly Independent States Internship Program in 1995. There are also some news clippings of League members from local newspapers in the scrapbook dated 1961-1995, many of which were loose. The scrapbooks were disassembled for preservation reasons or photocopied depending upon their contents. The Government Unit Activities scrapbook topics include representative government, the President and Electoral College, constitutional conventions, sunset laws, as well as other topics. The Oversized scrapbook spanning the years 1970-1073 and 1977-1978 documents an array of League activities and interests including voter service, housing, welfare, the Albany elected school board campaign and its conflict with Mayor Erastus Corning, the county charter drive, the voter harassment case filed against James Ryan, as well as other issues. The Albany elected school board collage includes news clippings as well as a cartoon signed by the artist Hy Rosen. A small number of images are available for viewing online from the University at Albany Libraries' Digital Collections database.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

id="aspace_dcaac1a8bf767170db4267df18a2a1a8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series is made up of videocassettes, audio cassettes and one CD-ROM. The LWVAC sponsored a Health Care Town Forum in 1983 and 1994, a Health Care Town Meeting in 1991, and a Power the Vote Town Meeting in 1996. Each of these was recorded on video. Other VHS tapes contain information relating to the League of Women Voters Education Fund Projects and projects of other local Leagues. Also on VHS and audiotape is the LWVAC History Night held on November 11, 1993. There are several interviews on audio cassettes from a LWVAC oral history project as part of the League's History Night. The oral history and History Night tapes feature members discussing their childhoods, how they became members of the League, and issues in which they were involved. The episode of WAMC's <emph render="italic">Vox Pop</emph> features a discussion with Becky Cain, president of the League of Women Voters, about politics and Albany politics. The audiotape of George Swiers includes a speech he gave at an unidentified event followed by a question and answer session in which he discusses diversity, the legislative process, and related issues. The CD-ROM disc contains a Power Point presentation, "Costs of Urban Sprawl", an education campaign done by the LWV of Buffalo/Niagara in 2001.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
