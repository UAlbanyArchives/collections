    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Joseph E. Persico, author and former speechwriter for New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, was born to Thomas and Blanche Persico of Gloversville, New York, on July 19, 1930. In 1952, after receiving a BA in both English and Political Science from the New York State College for Teachers (as the University at Albany was then known), he entered the U.S. Navy and remained in the military for three years. Persico served as a Lieutenant Junior Grade aboard a minesweeper and also with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Headquarters in Naples, Italy. Returning to the U.S. in 1956, Persico matriculated at Columbia University in New York for his graduate work.</p><p> In 1956, Joseph Persico began his political writing career, serving Governor W. Averell Harriman as a writer and researcher. After three years with Harriman, Persico then became a Foreign Service Officer for the United States Information Agency (USIA) working in Argentina, Brazil, and Washington. Between 1963 and 1966, Persico served as Executive Assistant to the New York State Health Commissioner, Hollis Ingraham. In 1966, Joseph Persico became the chief speechwriter for New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Continuing in this position for seven years, he remained Rockefeller's primary speechwriter as the Governor assumed the office of Vice President of the United States from 1974 to 1977.</p><p> In 1977, Joseph Persico transitioned into a full-time author, focusing on historical subjects. In that year, his Civil War piece, <emph render="italic">My Enemy My Brother: Men and Days of Gettysburg</emph>, was released. Two years later, he followed up this work with a novel, <emph render="italic">The Spiderweb</emph>, and a nonfiction study, <emph render="italic">Piercing the Reich: The Penetration of Nazi Germany by American Secret Agents During World War II</emph>. In 1982, Persico focused on Nelson Rockefeller's life and published the biography, <emph render="italic">The Imperial Rockefeller</emph>. During the 1990s, Persico created other historical works on both American espionage and the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials following World War II. These works were <emph render="italic">Casey: From the OSS to the CIA</emph> and <emph render="italic">Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</emph>. Persico also targeted renowned broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow for a biographical sketch in 1990. In addition to his books, Persico has also published numerous articles on American history.</p><p> Persico collaborated with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and later Secretary of State, Colin L. Powell, on his biography. Between 1994 and 1996, the author developed a personal relationship with his subject, occasionally addressing Powell as "Sir Colin", and "Mon General", from "The Hired Pen". Joseph Persico continues to publish books on historical subjects. In November 2001, Random House Inc. released <emph render="italic">Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage</emph> and in 2004, <emph render="italic">Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour: Armistice Day, 1918, World War I and Its Violent Climax</emph> was published.</p><p> Apart from his professional career, Joseph Persico's private life has been spent with his wife, Sylvia La Vista Persico, and his children, Vanya and Andrea. He currently lives in Guilderland, N.Y.</p><p> Chronological Index to Press Releases, Speeches, and Transcripts Written for Nelson A.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collected papers of Joseph Persico focus on his careers as a political speechwriter and as a full-time author. His speeches from the 1960s include his work for both New York State Commissioner of Health, Hollis Ingraham, and New York State Governor, Nelson Rockefeller. Press releases and transcripts associated with the speeches are also present in the Persico files. Nelson Rockefeller's Messages to the Legislature and "Quotes on Issues" during the late 1960s and early 1970s have been filed in Series 1 with Persico's speeches. The Chronological Index to Press Releases, Speeches, and Transcripts Written for Nelson A. Rockefeller was transcribed by Kevin Lawyer from the handwritten original provided by the donor. The index covers the years 1964-1976.</p><p> The author's publications files include manuscripts, correspondence, screenplays, interviews for <emph render="italic">The Imperial Rockefeller</emph>, and research notes. For Persico's <emph render="italic">Piercing the Reich</emph>, several folders hold parts of a single OSS (Office of Strategic Services) War Report from 1949, detailing OSS action in Europe, Africa, and Asia during World War II. For <emph render="italic">Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</emph>, the author's files contain a draft of the work and research material including photos from the Holocaust and the Nuremberg Trials.</p><p> The texts, drafts, news clippings, correspondence, and other supporting material is available for speeches and other non-book writings of Persico. Among the author's correspondence is an exchange with movie director John Huston who Persico interviewed for an article in <emph render="italic">American Heritage</emph>. Note that correspondence can be found throughout the collection. For example, references to Persico's publications will be found in both the general correspondence files and specific publications' series. An attempt was made to retain the original filing system of the creator with the most recent accessions, but previous arrangement divided some of the correspondence into professional and personal folders.</p><p> The material received from the donor in 2006, 2012-2013, and 2018 is not yet arranged and described in this finding aid. Contact Department staff for further information.</p><p> Additional material collected and created by Persico during the writing of <emph render="italic">Piercing the Reich</emph> was deposited by Persico at the Hoover Institution Library and Archives at Stanford University. The finding aid for this material is available online through the Online Archive of California. Persico also gave additional material related to his book <emph render="italic">Edward R. Murrow: An American Original</emph> to the Edward R. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy at Tufts University.</p>  </scopecontent>

book reviews, essays, magazine articles, newspaper articles and op-eds, non-fiction books, novels, plays, and television scripts. It contains correspondence, including e-mails (Persico's correspondence is not limited to folders labeled as such); contracts; drafts; event materials, interview questions and transcripts; memoranda; notes (he often wrote them on index cards); photographs; press clippings; research materials; scrapbooks; and speeches related to Persico's various writings. Notable research materials include copies of American intelligence and military communications and reports and copies of the correspondence of famous individuals, such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Some items, such as correspondence and research materials, are in French or German. </p><p>The materials often reference individuals with whom Persico collaborated. His daughter Vanya Maria Persico (he often referred to by her initials in his papers) assisted her father with clerical duties, such as typing up book manuscripts, during the process of researching and writing his books. Robert (Bob) Loomis was Joe Persico's editor at Random House. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2266a39958ff63d4992e95f7e2be6e38" level="subseries"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Piercing the Reich</emph></unittitle><unitid>2.1</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1.4 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1940/1979" type="inclusive">1940-1979</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_93435a34a5c56ae0374f2ca74787fec3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The <emph render="italic">Piercing the Reich</emph> subseries is primarily Persico's research material.

For example, references to Persico's publications will be found in both the general correspondence files and the subseries of specific publications. While some correspondence is clearly personal or professional, there is not always a clear separation between the author's personal and professional correspondents. Persico appears to have retained copies of much of his outgoing correspondence in the form of typed and handwritten letters and email messages. The author's notable correspondents include: director John Huston who Persico interviewed for an article in <emph render="italic">American Heritage</emph>; Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Michael Shaara (1983) and William Kennedy (1983); journalist Jim Lehrer (1986); Broadway and television director Edwin Sherin (1985); author Thomas Powers (1993); and Casey Murrow (1995, 1998) among
