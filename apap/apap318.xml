    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Victor A. Lord, Jr., a native of Schenectady, New York, obtained a law degree from Yale University after serving time overseas in World War II. In 1951 he returned to the Albany area and joined the law firm of McNamee, Lochner, Titus, and Williams. Lord also joined the Junior Chamber of Commerce, which indirectly led to an eye-opening view of Albany's Democratic Machine. His activities with the Chamber introduced him to his future wife, who would also be his partner in promoting social and political change in Albany. Together they became involved with reform groups like the Albany Independence Movement (AIM) and the Citizens United Reform Effort (CURE), both of which were foundations for the Albany Liberal Party. Lord and his colleagues worked to end corruption in local and state government, promoting an end to the five-dollar vote, end to racial prejudice, and greater variety of voices in political matters.</p>  </bioghist>
