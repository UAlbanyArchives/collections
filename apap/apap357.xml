    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Legislative Correspondents' Association of the State of New York (LCA), which began in 1890, is composed of journalists covering the State Capitol in Albany.  It is said to be one of the oldest organization of newspapermen in the country.  It wasn't until 1965 that women were permitted to join the LCA, although they were correspondents at the capital at the time.  This Collection reflects the organization as a whole rather than specific reporters, with the exeption of those referenced in the subject files. 
The LCA holds a dinner and satirical show each year, since the inaugural one given for Governor Theodore Roosevelt in 1900, poking fun at New York politics and politicians.  The program has grown from the simple beginnings of dinner and hijinks to the elaborate show put on for several hundred state politicians and guests that we have today.  The proceeds from the show go to help local charities throught New York State.</p>  </bioghist>

Some early show information can also be found in the administration series, where it was comingled with more executive and memebership topics.
