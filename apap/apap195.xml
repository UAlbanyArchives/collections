    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Founded in 1967, the Eighth Step is an independent, non-profit organization that was originally started in the basement of the First Presbyterian Church of Albany. Originally started as a First Presbyterian youth project, the Eighth Step held concerts of folk, traditional, ethnic, blues, and jazz music. Begun amidst the backdrop of the Civil Rights/Vietnam War era, the Eighth Step was strongly influenced by the political music of that era. Artists such as Arlo Guthrie, Greg Brown, Patty Larkin, Ani DiFranco, and John Gorka played there early in their careers. The old back entrance to the original space contained eight steps, hence the name. In 2000, the Eighth Step moved to the Cohoes Music Hall and held their last concert there in 2003. </p><p> The PRC was re-energized and the name changed following the September 11th 2001 attack and the US governments launch of its War on Terror.</p>  </bioghist>
