    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Tanya Melich was born in Moab, Utah on April 23, 1936. Her father, Mitchell Melich, was an active member of the Republican party and served in the Utah State Senate from 1942 to 1950. He ran for Congress in 1948, was the Republican nominee for Utah governor in 1964, served on the Republican National Committee for Utah from 1966 to 1968, and acted as solicitor for the United States Department of Interior from 1969 to 1973.</p><p> Tanya Melich attended the University of Colorado and received a B.S. in Political Science in 1958, graduating cum laude with departmental and general honors. She was also elected to Phi Betta Kappa. She then attended Columbia University, receiving a master's degree in Public Law and Government in 1961.</p><p>  Melich worked as a newspaper reporter for <emph render="italic"> The Salt Lake Tribune</emph> in the late 1950s. In 1956 she was a Ford Foundation Political Intern for the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Colorado. Her first campaign experience in New York occurred in 1959 when she helped Samuel Pierce's campaign for general sessions judge. She continued to work on state and national campaigns in various positions: 1961 Louis J. Lefkowitz for mayor, New York City; research director 1964 Mitchell Melich for governor, Utah; state campaign deputy director 1965 John V. Lindsay for mayor, New York City; director of research 1966 William J. Casey for Congress, New York; director of research 1966 Nelson A. Rockefeller for governor, New York; associate to the scheduling director 1968 Nelson A. Rockefeller for U.S. President; deputy director of national delegate unit 1969 John V. Lindsay for mayor, New York City; research consultant for Fioravanto Perrotta 1970 Charles Goodell Election Committee, New York; state chair of research 1972 Richard M. Nixon, New York City campaign for the Committee to Re-Elect the President; deputy campaign director 1977 Arch Gillies for City Council, New York City; campaign manager 1978 Perry Duryea for governor, New York; member, advisory committee 1978 Michael Roth for attorney general, New York; member, advisory committee 1982 Whitney North Seymour, Jr. for United States Senate, New York; state campaign manager 1989 Rudolf Giuliani for mayor, New York City; advisory committee.</p><p> In the early 1960s, Melich worked on the staff of the Foreign Policy Association, where she prepared information and analyses relating to special projects in Latin America. The Foreign Policy Association was, and remains, a national and nonprofit organization founded to educate Americans about international issues. Melich later worked for ABC-TV News in its election unit and was director of ABC-News National Election Research for the 1964 presidential election. Her work focused on conducting research for television and radio coverage of political events, particularly presidential politics. From 1975 to 1981 Melich worked in various positions for the Corporate Affairs division of CBS, Inc. At CBS she studied the impact of public policy issues on CBS. She also prepared and supervised the writing of opinion papers and reports during this time. In 1983, Melich went on to operate her own consulting business, Political Issues Management.</p><p> Melich has been heavily involved with several organizations relating to both political and social concerns over the last several decades. In the mid 1960s she became involved in the Ripon Society, a group concerned with the growing power of right-wing politicians in the Republican party. The Ripon Society has been described as, "a moderate Republican research and policy organization dedicated to a common sense, pragmatic system of governance." In 1974 she was elected the Ripon Society National Governing Board Chair. </p><p> Melich is considered one of the founders of the modern women's movement. In 1971 she helped organize the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus. She went on to co-found the New York State National Women's Political Caucus (NYS NWPC) in 1972. In 1973, she became affiliated with the National Women's Education Fund, the first organization designed to educate women on ways to gain political power. Melich served as the Fund's president from 1980 through 1983. Concerned with the treatment of women in American society, she wanted women's issues to have more of an impact on the Republican Party's agenda. In 1976 Melich co-founded the National Women's Republican Task Force and was instrumental in organizing the group New York State Republicans for Women's Issues. In 1984 she co-founded the New York State Republican Family Committee. Both of the organizations advocated the Republican Party to take a pro-choice stance and recognize the needs and concerns of women to a greater extent.</p><p>  Melich has also served as a member of several organizations concerned with the political and social state of America. Such organizations include: the United States Civil Rights Commission New York State Advisory Board and the New York State Commission on Judicial Nomination. She also served on the advisory board of the White House Project, a project to "change biases against women's leadership ability, and foster the entry of women into positions of leadership, including the U.S. presidency."</p><p> Her writings have appeared in <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Washington Post</emph>, <emph render="italic">Newsday</emph>, <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph>, <emph render="italic">USA Today</emph> <emph render="italic">Chicago Tribune</emph>, and the electronic publication <emph render="italic">Women's Enews</emph>. In addition to writing articles, Melich has also worked as writer, researcher, and/or editor on numerous books including: <emph render="italic">Jaws of Victory</emph> (Little Brown and Co. 1974), <emph render="italic">The Lessons of Victory</emph> (The Dial Press, 1969), <emph render="italic">Thomas E. Dewey on the American Political System</emph>, <emph render="italic">ABC News Fact Book for the 1964 presidential campaign</emph>, <emph render="italic">American Heritage State Series</emph> and <emph render="italic">Peace: The Control of National Power</emph> (Beacon Press, 1963). One of her most well-known works is <emph render="italic">The Republican War Against Women: An Insider's Report From Behind the Lines</emph>. Bantam Books published the title in 1996. It was described by <emph render="italic">The Washington Post</emph> as, "a powerful, evocative account of how social conservatives and Republican politicians have used the GOP to roll back the gains of the women's movement." The work received national attention from women's organizations and political groups. It was given the Gustavus Meyer Center Award as an outstanding book on human rights in North America. </p><p> Tanya Melich has received many other awards and honors for her work. She was honored by the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus as one of New York's outstanding women. She has received the New York NOW Susan B. Anthony Women of Achievement Award, the Alfred F. Moran Advocacy Award by Family Planning Advocates of New York, and was commemorated by the New York State National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL). She was a Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow, speaking on the United States political process and women. She has also been involved in civic, social, and political organizations such as Planned Parenthood-New York City Council of Advocates, New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs, and the Advisory Council of the Women's International Leadership of International House.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Tanya M. Melich Papers document the political and societal landscape of the United States with materials primarily from the latter half of the twentieth century. Much of the material focuses on the Republican Party on both a national and local level (particularly New York City, where Melich resides). There is information relating to Republican platforms, election concerns, political organizations, and voter demographics. Melich has consistently been extremely interested in women's rights—especially reproductive rights—and collected many materials relating to this topic. She also conducted research in a variety of other areas including: affirmative action, poverty, the impact of technology on broadcast media, overpopulation concerns, and human rights more generally. </p><p> The Melich Papers include many types of materials including newspaper clippings, academic articles, magazine articles, reports, memos, correspondence, and publications of advocacy organizations. Although the majority of these items were produced by other individuals or organizations, there are some materials written by Melich, including articles, some correspondence, and administrative materials from her time as President of the National Women's Education Fund.</p><p>This collection is divided into fifteen series and was originally processed in 2003. Over the next ten years, Melich sent approximately fifteen additional cubic feet of records, which were interfiled with the original materials to create one complete collection. In 2021, sixty-six additional boxes were processed from Melich's most recent donation in 2019, and three additional series were created: The White House Project, Women's Advocacy, and the New York State Republican Family Committee. </p><p>Because the previously processed materials related to women's political and social rights were not rearranged with the new series in 2021, please see the Subject Files series for materials related to the ones found in the Women's Advocacy series.</p>  </scopecontent>

There is also information relating to specific election and demographic concerns for the Republican Party. There is extensive documentation concerning Richard Nixon's U.S. presidential bids and the political realities of the early 1960s. In addition to specific elections, there are materials concerning the Republican Party more generally, such as its strengths and weaknesses and stances on particular social concerns. The News Clippings folders contain articles or entire pages of newspapers encompassing elections, editorials, Republican and Democratic platforms and candidates. Not all the clippings have been photocopied; the originals are often brittle and should be handled with care. The material is arranged by date of its creation. For example, documents created in 1963 regarding the 1964 election are in the folders for 1963.

Contents</head><p>These files contain material relevant to the specific campaigns for candidates either in New York State or national elections. While Series one is a collection of Melich's external research, this series contains information on campaign initiatives Melich was personally involved with. There are publications, campaign brochures (for either Republican or Democratic candidates), form letters, notes, correspondence, and reports within this series, many written by or for Melich. Some of the files include position papers, outlining a number of topics of importance to the election and a summary of the candidates' position. </p><p> This series features information related to Nelson Rockefeller's U.S. presidential campaign, including delegate files compiled for each state. These folders incorporate basic information regarding the political structure of states such as the names and addresses of Governor, Republican Campaign headquarters, and material related to the delegates for the 1968 Republican Convention. There is also information from The Committee for the Re-Election of the President (perjoratively referred to as "CREEP"), with materials concerning the campaign to elect Richard M. Nixon to a second term.</p><p>  This series also contains political publications and newsletters such as <emph render="italic">The National Review </emph>and <emph render="italic">Battle Line</emph>. These are filed chronologically within the series. Researchers interested in the campaigns and elections are advised to also look in Series One: Political Files which contains material related to many of the New York and national elections from the late 1950s through the 1970s. Oversized items of interest in this series include a paper shopping bag created for the Nelson A. Rockefeller for Governor campaign, a survey conducted for the Charles Goodell campaign, a map of New York's Congressional Districts, a U.S. Plywood land permit, 1982 New York State convention vote counts, and posters for the Charles Goodell and Jimmy Carter campaigns.  </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_075eaec781a78a5ea696c78321b61142" level="file"><did><unittitle>Election 1968 NAR Delegate

As a result, she accumulated numerous papers regarding the presidential primaries in New Hampshire and California, as well as the Republican National Convention and inaugural celebration. The series includes voting reports and analysis, general information on the convention, schedules, biographical information of candidates and platforms, committee meeting notes, and news clippings. The series begins with the New Hampshire primary in March, continues with the California and later primaries, the Republican National Convention in July, and ends with the inauguration of 1965. </p><p>  Each primary had a Facts Book created by the news unit. The Facts Book outlines details about the Election Day and gives information about candidates and election issues. The News and Numbers folders include news stories and numbers from the night of the election. General Files may include notes about the news coverage, sample ballots, maps of election districts, and related items. Materials for the California primary also include a few items related to the Democratic Party and a 37 page document titled the "Christian, Anti-Communist Crusade" which was written by the Christian, Anti-Communist Crusade in 1963 for delivery at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association. The group was concerned with the growth and purpose of extreme right wing political organizations. </p><p>  The Republican National Convention of 1964 was held at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Similar to the primaries, a "Facts Book" was created with information about the candidates, the convention arrangements, voting, and related information. The folder Convention Planning and Arrangements, includes theme plans, hotel arrangements, news clippings and press releases. There are also nomination speeches for Nelson A. Rockefeller, George Romney, William E. Miller and Barry Goldwater to be the presidential candidate. The series also includes remarks and presentations made throughout the convention from a variety of speakers. While Melich had documents concerning several candidates at the convention, she collected an extensive amount of information relating to Goldwater, such as his platform, the growth of the Goldwater movement, and the arguments of his proponents. The State Files include brief notes regarding Republican representation and delegates at the Convention. They are alphabetical by state with United States districts and territories at the end. </p><p> The ABC News Facts Book, Inauguration 1965 gives information about the location and history of the event, biographies of members of Congress, and all the details regarding the inauguration ceremony and ball.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_9c16b822bebbc54d91b8f263a6a67016"

Melich worked at CBS, Inc, in a variety of roles from 1975 until 1981, as the Editor of Corporate Information, the Associate Director of the Public Policy Unit, and as the Director of Civic Affairs within the Corporate Affairs Department. A significant portion of the collection focuses on CBS Polls, and how CBS covered elections, political conventions, etc. There is general information on the company, as well as the Public Policy Study Unit, a group studying the impact of new technology on broadcasting. Documents from a "Management Seminar," including notes, assignments and exercises are also included. Records from the Women's Advisory Committee, which was designed to help women develop their careers at CBS, are of note as well. Related documents to working women include files that pertain to a 1977 suit filed by Melinda Cotton against CBS regarding women's employment and possible discrimination. The folders related to this topic include legal documents, correspondence and articles by Sandra Purnell and Gloria Steinem. Other material in this series comes from the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies which sponsored a program on communication Melich participated in.

It formed in 1964 with the aim of improving the Republican Party, as members believed their original values had been compromised by catering to an extreme right-wing contingency. This series contains many copies of <emph render="italic">The Ripon Forum</emph>, a newsletter regarding politics which reflected the Society's views. The <emph render="italic">The Ripon Forum</emph> was published each month, and occasionally the Society issued a small, supplemental version, usually on the 1st or 15th of the month. There are also several copies of the <emph render="italic">Ripon Quarterly</emph>, a magazine publication of the organization. Both <emph render="italic">The Ripon Forum</emph> and <emph render="italic">Ripon Quarterly</emph>y are missing issues in the series, so not all dates are inclusive. </p><p> The series also contains Daily Office Files which include correspondence, press releases, news clippings, and reports by Melich. The year 1973 has the most substantial amount of material with a number of items related to Watergate, Nixon, and his eventual impeachment. There is also information on the New Leadership Fund, which was a fund-raising committee designed to help Republican candidates through monetary donations or research and campaign assistance. The materials include correspondence and reports related to the committee.</p><p> The series includes a few folders related to the Ripon Society chapter in New York City. These materials include correspondence, local government newsletters, and articles. The "Lessons of Victory" material contains chapter outlines and multiple drafts of chapter 3, "The Failures of the Republican Moderates" by Melich. It discusses the Nixon campaign, weaknesses within the Republican Party, and the political transition to the future. George H.W. Bush, then chair of the Republican National Committee, convened the Rule 29 committee in 1973. The purpose of the committee was to review, study, and work with the states and territories regarding the rules adopted by the 1972 Republican National Convention. It was also supposed to benefit the relationship between the Republican National Committee, Republican State Committees, and other Republican organizations. Items include memorandums, news clippings, and reports between the Rule 29 Committee and the Women's Political Caucus. It also includes Melich's testimony before the Rule 29 Committee in 1974.</p><p> The Ripon Society filed two lawsuits against the Republican National Committee and Republican Party, the first from 1970 to 1973 and the second from 1974 to 1975. The Society believed the Committee's process of allocating delegates was unconstitutional. Items for both suits are filed in two sections: general papers and legal papers. The general papers include memorandums, correspondence, press releases, news clippings, and reports. The legal papers include legal documents such as complaints and briefs. The law firm Patterson, Belknap and Webb in New York City handled the Ripon Society's case.</p><p> The book <emph render="italic">The New Political Order: A History of the Conservative Infrastructure</emph> is by John S. Saloma (1934-1983). The files about the book include notes, correspondence, and a review by Melich from 1984. Saloma was a founding member of the Ripon Society and President of the Ripon Society from 1963 to 1967. The manuscript was published posthumously under the title, <emph render="italic">Ominous Politics: The New Conservative Labyrinth </emph>(New York: Hill and Wang, 1984.)</p></scopecontent><c

David Rockefeller was one of the founders and served as chair during the period covered by these records, Arthur R. Taylor served as president. NYCP began as a collaborative association of 100 businesses, private-sector groups, and civic leaders to assist the city develop innovative volunteer projects. Partners included the Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Council. The majority of materials in this series concern transit problems in New York City in 1981, a summer job program for high school students, and a lunch hosted by NYCP in 1982 with President Ronald Reagan as a guest.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_a56c8e4809bdada0f18ea6a8e16f23e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Background Materials—White House</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1981/1981" type="inclusive">1981</unitdate><container id="aspace_d370f699e581d38fe42859f242ff77c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (6-New York City Partnership)</container><container id="aspace_7681bf918ea12bd539f43a5bcb6d07d3" parent="aspace_d370f699e581d38fe42859f242ff77c9" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f02fe81272f424679387cd72fb1148c9" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Material sent to the White House about the New York City partnership"</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1981/1981" type="inclusive">1981</unitdate><container id="aspace_0758873cb5068cdcbfc3ba806e13c50e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (6-New York City Partnership)</container><container id="aspace_17b7dcf5a163b2a76701a65cae6f7647" parent="aspace_0758873cb5068cdcbfc3ba806e13c50e" type="Folder">2-3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_815da17b62fdf34ff27db4845079a99f" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York City Partnership, Inc.

Contents</head><p>In November of 1977 the National Women's Conference was held in Houston, Texas. This meeting was preceded by state-wide meetings to elect delegates to attend the National Conference. At the state meetings and the National Conference the following issues were discussed: abortion, equal pay, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), child care, divorce and marriage laws, laws regarding rape and domestic violence, and other issues. The series includes materials related to the New York State and Utah Women's Meetings and the National Conference. This material includes pre-conference newsletters, reports, correspondence, agendas, conference materials, notes, and news clippings. Tanya Melich was co-chair of the New York State IWY Resolutions Committee in the summer of 1977. She was one of the few Republicans on the committee.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_00a0402d1509edccb56b7dbb79e7eab3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Business Council for the United Nations Decade for

Contents</head><p>Tanya Melich consistently received material from numerous political, academic, and social organizations. Many of the folders contain content such as letters, brochures, newsletters, or publications. Melich was involved in some of the organizations represented, such as the National Women's Education Fund (NWEF), for which she served as President from 1980-1983. There is extensive information relating to NWEF operations such as budget information, fundraising efforts, board information, and publications. There is also documentation from the Women's Political Caucus, a grassroots organization dedicated to increasing women's involvement in politics, which has historically been male-dominated. Melich also collected information on the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, including yearly reports, informational publications for communities, and the tactics it took to combat STOPP, an anti-Planned Parenthood group. Melich was also very active as a board member with her local chapter, Planned Parenthood of New York City, so many records related to that chapter are administrative in nature. </p><p>In general, many of the organizations relate particularly to women's causes and the Republican Party. However, there is also organizational information on groups dedicated to combating environmental issues (especially overpopulation). There is a relatively large amount of information on The International Women's Rights Action Watch including correspondence, documents regarding the Convention on the Elimination of the Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and a 12 year run of its newsletter <emph render="italic">The Woman's Watch</emph>. The folders are arranged in alphabetical order by the full name of the organization. </p><p>There are some audio/video items in this series as well, including cassette tapes from an anti-Planned Parenthood group. Planned Parenthood was able to secure the tapes and used them to study the arguments of the opposing groups so it could better respond in the media.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_8f65e926bf1e0c884d6b22aca827c27c" level="file"><did><unittitle>The 80% Majority Campaign—"The Campaign Report," Vol. 3 No. 14-23, Vol. 4 1-10</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1989/1990" type="inclusive">1989-1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_5c721afb800521e659b359518c05cfa0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (9-Organizations)</container><container id="aspace_c2423e56a498b944d182123f746b3186" parent="aspace_5c721afb800521e659b359518c05cfa0" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_68b739318bd7f9bf844c674b0a1207fe" level="file"><did><unittitle>The 80% Majority Campaign—"The Campaign Report," Vol. 4 No. 11-17, Vol. 5 No. 1, 2</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1991/1991" type="inclusive">1991</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1993/1993" type="inclusive">1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_88ac7d219ce979177f47b344d4c5c758" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (9-Organizations)</container><container id="aspace_55d2fb3217ad4e0b5c06d7fc80c9f2d5" parent="aspace_88ac7d219ce979177f47b344d4c5c758" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_39fdb15883c7b0f9f254fdf00c58e9c3" level="file"><did><unittitle>85 Broads</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="2003/2003" type="inclusive">2003</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1956/2009" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_9c078fadad285f63546a2f3d0976d39a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (9-Organizations)</container><container id="aspace_544ea0ffc0d4380af50de054f7da0f6a" parent="aspace_9c078fadad285f63546a2f3d0976d39a" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_4377fb71284080ddbe640cbefb452d6b" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Academy of Political Science—"Urban Riots: Violence and Social Change, Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science"</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1968/1968" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_5705b40601e2c34b4d2b6ca1a826aa8d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (9-Organizations)</container><container id="aspace_b3b282f3f41d57d6cf058dfc538e3e1c" parent="aspace_5705b40601e2c34b4d2b6ca1a826aa8d" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_235ddf28b3d1d46f8ede254a2ec47ddb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alan Guttmacher Institute</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1993/1994" type="inclusive">1993-1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_e3e4a82495bd68955864d94d524be602" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (9-Organizations)</container><container id="aspace_19c7c06517084ab9aadf8329fd09ab80" parent="aspace_e3e4a82495bd68955864d94d524be602" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_46c088e0624207e4a13e54fd2fde844b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alan Guttmacher Institute, "Sex and America's Teenagers"</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1994/1994" type="inclusive">1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_3e196f25c5404c7a54111ab593573e67" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (9-Organizations)</container><container id="aspace_496626f330c884e25d62670f51def9c3" parent="aspace_3e196f25c5404c7a54111ab593573e67" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c833a3268a4e69872d177faecf603a93" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Association of Political Consultants—"Politea," and Misc.

Within the Association of New York State Young Republican Clubs, 1932-1959." There are copies of speeches she gave on various occasions. There is also information relating to Melich's editing work on an autobiography for Thomas E. Dewey. The materials relating to Dewey include two chapters of his autobiography, the transcript of a lengthy interview he conducted with reporter Harlan B. Phillips in 1957, some background research on Dewey conducted by Phillips, and chronologies.</p><p> Also included in this series are files related to a book Melich worked on for Dan Yankelovich in 1984. Melich interviewed David Cohen, Betty Friedan, George Lodge, Samuel D. Proctor, Leon Shapiro, and others for their comments on certain chapters of the manuscript. The David Cohen material includes several IBM magcards which were recorded text as it was typed onto paper with a typewriter. The cards could then be used to recall and reprint the text. There is a list of page numbers and their corresponding magcard numbers. The Yankelovich files also contain background research and early drafts of some chapters.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f1b64dae4658ce7a30d1e04378e772a2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1989/1990" type="inclusive">1989-1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_738738285e0dfe97df5b06b18a75c67f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (12-Melich Publications, Speeches, and Editing Work)</container><container id="aspace_3ea0d5b074de9ba9d3cabfbe25365e57" parent="aspace_738738285e0dfe97df5b06b18a75c67f" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9c60edf28445503177295791283aa3e7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Materials for Thomas E.
