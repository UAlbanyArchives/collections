    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Nancy Papish, a resident of Schenectady, New York, became involved with environmental activism at a local and regional level in the 1970s. Papish's papers document her involvement with Clearwater, North River Friends of Clearwater (NRFC), and the campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec's development plan for James Bay in northern Quebec.</p><p> Clearwater refers to both a boat and an environmental organization of more than 10,000 members. Clearwater's history dates to the late 1960s when folk singer and activist Pete Seeger became interested in building a recreation of the sloops that traveled the Hudson River in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Hudson River Sloop Restoration (HRSR) was the precursor organization, which eventually became Hudson River Sloop Clearwater (HRSC). Its original goal was simply to build the sloop that Seeger envisioned. However, most HRSR members also shared an interest in cleaning up the polluted Hudson River. They decided to use the boat as a "floating classroom", raising public awareness about the need to protect the Hudson by conducting educational sails on the river.</p><p> The Hudson River Sloop Clearwater launched in 1969. Today, more than 12,000 people sail on the Clearwater each year. The crew is comprised of paid staff and Clearwater member volunteers. The organization's efforts expanded over the years to include advocating for green space along the river's banks as well as upkeep of the river itself. Clearwater is also well-known for its annual Great Hudson River Revival, a festival of music, arts, and environmental education. [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. (undated) "About Clearwater". Accessed 27 January 2005, http://www.clearwater.org/about.html].</p><p> Founded in the early 1970s, the North River Friends of Clearwater is a sloop club based in the Capital District. Sloop clubs are local organizations that support Clearwater's mission through activities like fundraising and public relations. NRFC, which has an office in downtown Albany, holds monthly meetings regarding sloop issues and works with other local environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club, Save the Pinebush, and the Adirondack Mountain Club on issues of mutual concern. [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. (undated) "Clearwater Sloop Clubs". Accessed 27 January 2005, http://www.clearwater.org/clubs.html].</p><p> Nancy Papish served on numerous committees for the NRFC and played a significant role in coordinating efforts between the Capital Region sloop club and the HRSC parent organization. As an early member of the group, she narrated a slide show that educated the public about Clearwater's mission and was even chosen as a volunteer crew member aboard the sloop in 1978. She brought a wealth of educational skills to Clearwater's activities since her background included three-four years teaching high school English, teaching an undergraduate education class at SUNY Albany, and multiple years working with the National Teacher Corps Project. Papish's recreational skills ran the gamut from canoeing, to sailing, to nautical arts like knot-tying, which made her a valuable addition to Clearwater's efforts. [Nancy Papish Papers. Series 1, Box 2, Folder 8. M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, University Libraries, University at Albany, State University of New York].</p><p> NRFC was one of many organizations that participated in a grassroots campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec's proposed James Bay II project in the early 1990s. New York State contracted with Hydro-Quebec to purchase electric power through 2018. Hydro-Quebec planned to build several dams in the subarctic James Bay region of Quebec. This enraged environmental and human rights activists, who argued that the dams would destroy an ecosystem on which native Cree and Inuit communities depended. In 1994, the New York Power Authority canceled its final contract with Hydro-Quebec.</p><p> May 2009 brought double reasons for celebration as the HRSC family commemorated the sloop's fortieth anniversary and Pete Seeger's ninetieth birthday. Both the sloop and the man responsible for her existence were honored in a concert at Madison Square Garden on May 3, 2009, complete with performers from Dar Williams to Joan Baez. [Art Beat. (30 July 2009). "Pete Seeger's 90th Birthday Blowout on PBS". Accessed 16 Oct. 2009, http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2009/07/pete-seegers-90th-birthday-blowout-on-pbs.html]. The Clearwater's trip up the Hudson River to Albany that spring added to the festive atmosphere as she led a flotilla of boats in honor of Henry Hudson's 1609 exploration.</p><p> HRSC is also making strides in a new program called the Next Generation Legacy Project, which focuses on green jobs in a green economy for the 21st century. The project will advance in three phases, the first of which began in spring 2009 with the opening of the Clearwater Center for Environmental leadership in Beacon, NY. The ultimate goal is to open eight green cities/green jobs satellite centers in environmental leadership. These will be located all along the Hudson River and will teach children and young adults about renewable resources and a sustainable environment. [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. (10 Feb. 2009). "Clearwater Announces Next Generation Legacy Project". Accessed 23 September 2009, http://www.clearwater.org/home/535.html].</p><p> In honor of its work in the environmental movement, the Clearwater received a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers document the environmental activism of Nancy Papish from the 1970s through the 1990s, focusing strongly on her involvement with Clearwater and North River Friends of Clearwater, as well as the campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec from building dams in the James Bay region of Quebec. Included are meeting minutes, notes, mailings, press releases, news clippings, magazine articles, programs, posters, and publications. The Clearwater files contain near-complete runs of newsletters produced by both NRFC and the parent Clearwater organization. Evidence of NRFC's outreach activities is found in a slide show titled "This Is Clearwater" and numerous poster displays.</p><p> Most of the Clearwater files contain information that was disseminated widely to members, such as mailings, brochures, and publications. The "Clearwater" series has some documentation of Clearwater's organization and administration, such as meeting minutes and internal reports, though most of the minutes pertain to the parent group HRSC, not North River Friends. There is little information about the membership of Clearwater. Documents pertaining to groups and projects that share Clearwater's interests, but were not produced by Clearwater, make up the majority of the subject files.</p><p> Since the campaign to stop development in James Bay was grassroots in nature, the James Bay files contain materials from several organizations. Detail about the structure and history of these organizations is lacking, as well as information about individual participants in the movement.</p><p> The papers do not contain much personal correspondence, and biographical information on Papish is equally scarce. Although there are files related to environmental education, there is no documentation of Papish's professional life as an English teacher at Schoharie Central School. There are quite a few subject files pertaining to other environmental groups that Papish supported, as well as groups related to the arts. The collection also features memorabilia, mainly tying in to the Clearwater and its fundraising/awareness activities.</p><p> Several collections in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives provide further information on the environmental issues that were of concern to Papish. For a complete list of collections on the subject of conservation and the environment, see http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/conservation.htm. Of particular note are the records of Environmental Advocates of New York, Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter, Environmental Clearinghouse of Schenectady, and the Solidarity Committee of the Capital District (APAP-024), which contain files on the campaign to stop Hydro-Quebec's James Bay project.</p>  </scopecontent>

id="aspace_902a0cc9f00519347a5409315d142951"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of Papish's files on Hydro-Quebec's James Bay project and the efforts of activists to stop the project. It includes news clippings, political cartoons, press releases, meeting announcements and minutes, magazine articles, fliers, brochures, and mailings from organizations involved in the campaign to stop James Bay II. These organizations include P.R.O.T.E.C.T., the James Bay Action Network, the James Bay Defense Coalition, the New York James Bay Network, and the Student Environmental Action Coalition. There are also files with background information on the native populations of Quebec, particularly the Cree and Innu populations.</p><p> Also found in this series is information on the 1990 Odeyak voyage, in which Cree and Inuit community members traveled from their homes to New York City in a boat that was a cross between a kayak and a canoe. The Odeyak passengers received food and housing from activists along their route, and Papish helped arrange accommodations for them in the Albany area. In 1994, New York activists staged a recreation of the Odeyak trip between Albany and New York City.</p><p> The items in folders marked "News Clippings, Press Releases, and Mailings" were originally housed in a large binder. The archivist maintained the original order of materials within the binder.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ceefda97a03dd7b7f244f58d9477ba43"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged

recreation. There are files on several specific environmental organizations such as Environmental Clearinghouse of Schenectady and the Hudson River Waterway Association. Also included are three folders of plates with historical images of Albany streets. These images came from an unidentified publication, and their relationship to other items in the collection is uncertain. Finally, there are U.S. Geological Survey maps (saved from the woodshed of the ferry sloop Woody Guthrie) which are housed with the oversized materials.

series contains photographs, a slide show with accompanying Cassette, a videocassette, and an Cassette.</p><p> There are 24 photographs or postcards, most housed in sleeves and many of which are unidentified. Some of the photos depict James Bay activists, as well as what is probably a model of the Odeyak. Others depict several brick buildings. Two photographs depict what appears to be a group of high school age students. One photograph, depicting two Native hunters standing with a kill, was used as a postcard. There is a message on the back from Gretchen McHugh to Nancy Papish, dated May 7, 1991. Also included are several postcards featuring various old sloops, one color photo of the Hudson River Dayline, two identical 5 × 7 B &amp; W photos of the Clearwater on the river, an 8 × 10 B &amp; W photo of the Clearwater at sea, and one 8 × 10 color photo of the sloop from 1984. The latter was originally housed in an acrylic picture frame, but the archivist removed and sleeved it for preservation purposes.</p><p> NRFC produced the slide show, titled "This Is Clearwater", in 1978. The show consists of eighty slides. There are also several additional slides which were probably not a part of this show. It is possible that some of them were a part of another NRFC slide show titled "Transportation Along the Hudson", but little information about this show is available. The slides are accompanied by an audiotape with narration by Nancy Papish and two typewritten copies of the narration script. The audiotape is approximately 26 minutes long. The slide show serves as an introduction to both Clearwater and North River Friends of Clearwater.</p><p> The videocassette contains a documentary titled "Hudson River Chronicle: Room at the Top". The documentary was produced by WMHT Educational Telecommunications in 1989. It includes a lengthy segment on Clearwater, including footage of educational activities on the sloop. Other topics covered are river geography and history; canoeing, rafting, and fishing; PCB contamination of the river; the Hudson's role in New York's canal system; the Hudson River School of painting; and protests of a home port for nuclear missiles in New York Harbor. Running time is approximately 90 minutes.</p><p> The Cassette contains "Capitol Connection" #9351, originally aired on Northeast Public Radio WAMC on December 22, 1993.

The James Bay memorabilia includes two T-shirts printed with a bird logo and the phrase "We Don't Have to Lose James Bay". A third T-shirt is printed with "Je Me Souviens . . . de la Riviere Grande Baleine. Sauvons la Riviere Grande Baleine". There is a bumper sticker of the same design as the "Je Me Souviens?" James Bay T-shirt.</p><p> Sloop materials include two copies of Clearwater's "Litterbag Songbook", a plastic shopping bag printed with lyrics for several traditional songs. There are two complete T-shirts with images of the Clearwater; one has the name of the sloop on it while the the other reads "North River Friends of Clearwater". There is also a collection of T-shirt fronts, cut out of the original garments so that just the decoration on the front was saved. The series also features a dozen Clearwater buttons and several canvas banners used at sails and fundraisers. About half a dozen banners and posters were rolled into map tubes for preservation and can be found in the oversize series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e147228f982f717ca6c78cbf9c26a304"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged by format.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ab23092cdb53d838aac12da80c9fd6dc" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Je Me Souviens de la Riviere Grande Baleine", T-shirt</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_ad83c69a13ea3c946ea25837b8ff7c8a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_56f6185b2a6b48fa76329c699612a55f" parent="aspace_ad83c69a13ea3c946ea25837b8ff7c8a" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e9c0fc28b8f2a8516bc40edf7224d6e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>"We Don't Have to Lose James Bay", T-shirts</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_283cc6d6030ac1895a582edd4292fc70" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_23d8720312b0dddccc0b924521e9e97b" parent="aspace_283cc6d6030ac1895a582edd4292fc70" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_063027c6c988ffe6c4e74507a3d7c0d4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Litterbag Songbook</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b721c495381d8b029e98e96aff4a8df1" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_36213c5114cd77177c7b7794f22066cc" parent="aspace_b721c495381d8b029e98e96aff4a8df1" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_063e3f5c895d60888d309ec6046a2bf3" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Je Me Souviens de la Riviere Grande Baleine", Bumper Sticker</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_6d78125191f72839e5c101016a1d9a78" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_33e57c22cc9f289ae8795f6eea97bb3f" parent="aspace_6d78125191f72839e5c101016a1d9a78" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_233164f4c42d937e6e007f30a197017f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sample T-Shirt Screen Prints on Cotton, Two Whole T-Shirts, Various Sayings and Images</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_7e05af345bc5251a70124601ce0dac1d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_b3a877e95cc6216b3846c72d73f851ca" parent="aspace_7e05af345bc5251a70124601ce0dac1d" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_fed17b78287f56ef79f2a751fd0ce8e9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Canvas Banner: Rummage Sale</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_c385e6a847cc9ad55df79a4ba93e5f6d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_fcb0547acac2178d021073a6100f286d" parent="aspace_c385e6a847cc9ad55df79a4ba93e5f6d" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f4b64c36dba32197f2cc347b03eced13" level="file"><did><unittitle>Canvas Banner: Sloop Festival</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f4ed2d28f04316115a80956fca8242f8" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_47ce7b84022bfe8c86723a14600c10f5" parent="aspace_f4ed2d28f04316115a80956fca8242f8" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_934b6911c4570bae16ba36c1ae66f8ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dozen Blue Buttons with Sloop Silhouette, All Say "Clearwater"</unittitle><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_dd9bb8ba0e0ded9d6107ff69ef9a9e7e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2 (7-Memorabilia)</container><container id="aspace_b7e5b56ecf59582c88591a4b8e561a7e" parent="aspace_dd9bb8ba0e0ded9d6107ff69ef9a9e7e" type="Folder">4</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_10cadee10ba834091e281431649d8297" level="series"><did><unittitle>Oversized Materials - Posters, Displays, and Advertisements</unittitle><unitid>8</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1.5 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1973/1975" type="inclusive">1973-1975</unitdate><unitdate normal="1978/1979" type="inclusive">1978-1979</unitdate><unitdate normal="1990/1993" type="inclusive">1990-1993</unitdate><unitdate normal="1953/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dae3a02864ca7b622a18d902e6ad4a51"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of oversized posters, maps, and tabloid-size publications, most of which relate to either Clearwater or James Bay. Four items that arrived at the archives tightly rolled are housed in map tubes; two banners are rolled around the outside of map tubes and housed in archival-quality muslin bags.</p><p> In addition, fifteen large posterboard displays used as promotional tools by NRFC originally accompanied Nancy Papish's papers. For preservation reasons, most of these displays were disassembled. Items from the displays were placed in folders, along with photographs of the original exhibits. Since most of the displays were untitled, the archivist added numbers to identify each one. The box for this series contains a folder for each display that was disassembled. All items that could be removed from the displays were placed in the appropriate folders. Some displays were missing items that had once been attached. It is likely that these items were removed by NRFC for use in other displays. Displays with items missing are marked as incomplete in the . Display 12 included a large New York State map that was glued to the posterboard; this was kept intact.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
