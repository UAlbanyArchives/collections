    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>John E. Kingston, also known as Jack Kingston, was born on December 11, 1925 in Niagara Falls, New York. Kingston and his family moved to Nassau County in 1929 and he went on to graduate from Mount Hermon School and get his A.B. from Williams College in 1948. After college, Kingston graduated from New York University Law School in 1950 and began practicing law in Mineola, New York. </p><p>Kingston was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly from 1960-1974 and served as Majority Leader from 1969-1974. Kingston served as the chair of the New York State chapter of Committee to Re-Elect the President. Kingston also served as the chairman of the 1972 Republican Assembly Campaign Committee. During his time in this position he was indicted for violation of Section 457 of State Election Law, and was accused of distributing fraudulent letters. The case was eventually dismissed in 1974 on grounds of "overbreadth." After his time in the Assembly, Kingston went on to serve as a Judge on the Nassau County Court. Kingston sat in this position until 1994, when he was elected to the New York Supreme Court. Kingston died on May 5, 1996, and was buried at the Nassau Knolls Cemetery in Port Washington, New York.</p>  </bioghist>
