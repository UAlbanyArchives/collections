    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Vera P. "Mike" Michelson (1945-2019) was a lifelong activist and organizer. Born in Northampton, Mass., she received her bachelor's degree from Russell Sage College and then a Master of Science degree in Education from the University at Albany.</p><p>Michelson was an employee of the State of New York for many years at the Oswald D. Heck developmental center. She retired in 2004, previously serving as president of her CSEA (Civil Service Employees Association) Local #445.</p><p>In 1981, Michelson helped organize the Capital District Coalition Against Apartheid and Racism (CD-CAAR) which opposed the U.S. tour of the South African Springbok rugby team, including its visit to Albany, N.Y. This led to even greater national and international anti-apartheid work and travel for Michelson who testified before the United Nations and traveled to an African National Congress Conference in Zambia. In Albany and the Capital District, Michelson was involved with many efforts involving social and racial justice. She led CD-CAAR's efforts to stop police brutality; was involved with efforts to reform the criminal justice system; worked to bring LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) to Albany; served as a volunteer administrator for Urban Grief, which supports families and communities traumatized by violence; helped to found ROOTS (Re-Entry Opportunities and Orientation Toward Success), a group established by ex-offenders and supporters to mentor the formerly incarcerated; and was involved with SNUG anti-gun violence initiatives. </p><p>Predeceased by her parents, she was survived by her brother and sister-in-law David and Carmen, her niece and nephews and their families.</p>  </bioghist>
