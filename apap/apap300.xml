    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Leonel Herrera was sentenced to die after his conviction in the shooting death of Enrique Carrisalez, a police officer who had stopped him for speeding in the Rio Grande Valley in 1981.This collection consists of materials related to the case of Leonel Herrera, convicted of the murder in the early 1980s and sentenced to death. As new evidence presented by Herrera's appeal lawyers could not be presented in Texas courts 10 years later, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court of the United States which denied Herrera's appeal in the 1993 decision Herrera v. Collins. The State of Texas executed Herrera on May 12, 1993.</p>  </bioghist>
