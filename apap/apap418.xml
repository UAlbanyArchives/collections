    <head>Organizational History</head>
<p>The Democratic Rural Conference (DRC) of New York State was formally established in September 1996 with 44 members from 27 counties although the idea of the DRC had percolated for many years prior. The DRC sought greater rural representation in the statewide party, a more formalized structure to understand and share voter concerns in small counties with statewide leaders and candidates, and to carry the Democratic message with New Yorkers in small towns and villages. </p><p>Today, the DRC continues to strengthen the Democratic Party and promote the interests of and address the concerns of rural New Yorkers within the party and in statewide government. The DRC represents the 47 counties with populations under 250,000. Democratic Party County Chairs and State Committee Members from those counties are voting members.</p>  </bioghist>
