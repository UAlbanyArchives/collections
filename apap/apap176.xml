    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>Appointed in 1971 by the Administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals was tasked with creating the first-ever national criminal justice standards and objectives for crime reduction and prevention at the state and local levels.  The 1971 Commissionâ€™s work built upon the report of the 1967 Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice entitled "The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society," and the reports of its task forces.  In 1973 the National Advisory Commission issued six reports each developed by a separate task force with dozens of staff members.</p>  </bioghist>
