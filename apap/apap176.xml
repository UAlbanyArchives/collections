    <head>Historical Sketch</head>
<p>Appointed in 1971 by the Administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals was tasked with creating the first-ever national criminal justice standards and objectives for crime reduction and prevention at the state and local levels.  The 1971 Commission's work built upon the report of the 1967 Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice entitled "The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society," and the reports of its task forces.  In 1973 the National Advisory Commission issued six reports each developed by a separate task force with dozens of staff members.</p>  </bioghist>
