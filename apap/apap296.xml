    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Sherwood Louis Boehlert was born on September 28, 1936, in Utica, New York. He graduated from Utica College and served for two years in the U.S. Army (1956-1958). He is a retired Republican politician from New York. </p><p>Boehlert retired in 2006, after serving in the U.S. Congress (NY-24th District) since first elected in 1982. Among Congressman Boehlert's many achievements was his chairmanship of the House Science Committee; he also served on committees on Transportation and Infrastructure. By appointment of the Speaker of the House, Congressman Boehlert served for eight years as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he was on the front line of essential intelligence decisions faced by Congress. </p><p>Early in 2003, the Speaker appointed Boehlert to serve on the newly created Select Committee on Homeland Security. In addition, to be a leader on science issues, Boehlert's legislative experience and seniority made him one of the most influential members of Congress. National Journal featured him as one of a dozen "key players" in the House. Time Magazine highlighted Congressman Boehlert as a power center on Capitol Hill. Congressional Quarterly regularly named Boehlert, one of the 50 most effective lawmakers in Washington.</p>  </bioghist>
