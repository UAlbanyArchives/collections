    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>John J. McEneny represented the 104th district in the New York State Assembly, which encompasses portions of Albany County, including parts of the city of Albany, the towns of Guilderland and New Scotland, and the Helderberg Hill towns of Berne, Knox, Westerlo and Rensselaerville. A member of the Democratic Party, he has served on several committees, including steering (chair), ethics and guidance, ways and means, governmental employees, and social services, and as Acting Speaker ProTempore on weekends, holidays and non-session days. Born in Albany in 1943, McEneny received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Siena College. Prior to his election to the Assembly in 1992, McEneny served in other public service roles. He began his career as a social services caseworker in 1965 and later Mayor Erastus Corning appointed him Albany's first Director of Manpower Planning, Director of Public Employment Programs, and Commissioner of Human Resources, 1971-84. In 1985 McEneny became director of the State Urban Cultural Parks Program and, from 1989-1991, was Assistant Albany County Executive.</p>  </bioghist>
