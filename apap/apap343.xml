    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Sierra Club is a national environmental organization founded in California in 1892 by naturalist and explorer John Muir. The founding members of the Club created guides to Sierran geography and wrote papers on natural history. The founding members often took hikes and explored nature on the West coast. As the Club began to grow, it split off into different sections and regions. The Eastern Region of the Sierra Club mostly contains chapters east of the Mississippi River. Please see the Sierra Club, Atlantic Chapter Records (APAP130) for related materials about environmental work in the Adirondacks.</p>  </bioghist>
