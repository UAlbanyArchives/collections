    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Born in Campbell, a rural part of Texas in 1951, David Powell was his high school valedictorian and enrolled in the honors program at the University of Texas at Austin at 16. Dropping out of college at 18, he became addicted to drugs and had a daily methamphetamine habit.</p>

<p>On May 18, 1978 in Austin, Texas, Powell was a passenger in a car pulled over by Officer Ralph Ablanedo for not displaying a rear license plate. Officer Ablanedo was shot multiple times with an AK-47 from the vehicle. A live grenade was also thrown from the vehicle. Although he was wearing a bullet proof vest Officer Ablanedo was shot four times and died from his wounds.</p>

<p>Powell was convicted of Officer Ablanedo's murder in October 1978. His then-girlfriend and the vehicle's driver, Sheila Meinert, received a four-year sentence.</p>

<p>In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Powell's conviction and death sentence. Powell was retried in 1991 and again sentenced to death. In 1994, this sentence was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. In 1999, a new sentencing hearing was held and Powell was again sentenced to death. On June 11, 2010, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted against clemency, then Texas Governor Rick Perry declined to stop the execution and last minute appeals to the courts were not successful.</p>

<p>David Lee Powell was executed on June 15, 2010 by the state of Texas. He had been on Death Row for more than half of his life.</p>  </bioghist>
