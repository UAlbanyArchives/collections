    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Greyhound Strikers Solidarity Committee of the Capital District was created by Albany, New York-area labor union activists who supported the autumn 1983 Amalgamated Transit Union strike against Greyhound Bus Lines and the organization continued to work for labor and social justice for more than two decades until 2025.</p><p>After the 1983 strike ended, the organization was reconstituted as the Solidarity Committee of the Capital District (SCCD), a standing committee of the Albany County Federation of Labor (ACFL) [Solidarity Council of the Capital District (SCCD) meeting minutes, 12 January 1984; Greyhound Lines Strike folder, in Series 3, Subject Files, 1980-90, Solidarity Committee of the Capital District Records, 1980-90. The Greyhound strike precipitated similar developments elsewhere in the United States. See Kim Moody, An Injury to All: The Decline of American Unionism, Haymarket Series, ed. Mike Davis and Michael Sprinker (London: Verso, 1988), 309-13]. The ACFL was the umbrella organization of area AFL-CIO union locals, but the relations between the SCCD, which welcomed members of non-AFL-CIO unions, and the AFL-CIO were often tense. In early 1990, the Schenectady Central Labor Council complained that the SCCD was overstepping the ACFL's geographic jurisdiction. National AFL-CIO officials then asserted that the January 1984 ACFL meeting minutes made no mention of the SCCD's standing committee status and that the SCCD thus had no formal ties to the AFL-CIO [SCCD meeting minutes, 14 May 1987, 11 January 1990, and 24 January 1990, in Series 1, Meeting Minutes, 1983-90, Solidarity Committee of the Capital District Records; Solidarity Notes, February 1990 and April 1990, in Series 2, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, 1983-90, Solidarity Committee of the Capital District Records, 1984-90]. The SCCD followed through by drafting a resolution that established their ties to the Albany County Federation of Labor since 1984. The resolution was presented at the March 7, 1990 meeting of the ACFL and passed as a constitutional amendment, thereby recognizing the SCCD as a standing committee of the AFL-CIO [Solidarity Committee subject files, Series 3/Box 1/Folder 10. "Albany County Central Federation of Labor- Solidarity Challenge" (1990)].</p><p> The SCCD's mission was "to promote solidarity and understanding of the labor movement, through educating and organizing in times of need". Its founders envisioned an organization that would organize and support strikes, protest closures of manufacturing plants, aid unemployed workers, lobby for political and economic reform, and organize non-union workers [SCCD meeting minutes, 12 January 1984]. Their vision continues to guide the SCCD's activities through the present day. They sponsor showings of labor-oriented films, establish training sessions for labor organizers, and consistently support workers engaged in area labor disputes.</p><p> While the SCCD's purpose originated with the Amalgamated Transit Union strike in Albany, NY, it was not long before their helping hands extended well beyond New York's Capital Region. Over the years, the SCCD began supporting labor efforts throughout New York State, then across the northeast, until eventually they were active in national issues (ex. the table-grape boycott initiated by the United Farm Workers). Now their specialty is providing financial and psychological support to workers engaged in labor disputes throughout the United States while raising awareness of labor issues worldwide [For the SCCD's support of the grape boycott, see the Grape Boycott -- United Farm Workers folder, in Series 3, Subject Files, 1980-90]. Although chiefly concerned with labor issues, the SCCD is also actively interested in many other social issues. It has ties to reform-oriented organizations such as the Student Association of the University at Albany, SUNY and the New York State [Family] Farm Association [SCCD Meeting Minutes, 14 May 1987, in Series 1, Meeting Minutes, 1983-90, and <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, July 1987, September 1987, June 1988, and April 1990, in Series 2, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, 1984-90], and has supported campaigns against South African apartheid <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, April 1985 and March 1990, in Series 2, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, 1984-90, and Apartheid Protests in Albany, NY folder and Divestment Lobbying Day, Albany, NY (March 19, 1985) folder, in Series 3, Subject Files, 1980-90], human-rights abuses in Central and Latin America [SCCD meeting minutes, 9 July 1987 and 17 March 1989, in Series 1, Meeting Minutes, 1983-90, and <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, February 1988, September 1988, February 1990, and March 1990, in Series 2, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, 1984-90], nuclear weapons proliferation [SCCD meeting minutes, 14 February 1985 and 9 April 1987, in Series 1, Meeting Minutes, 1983-90, and <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, April 1987, in Series 2, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, 1984-90], and use of synthetic bovine growth hormone [SCCD meeting minutes, 13 April 1989, in Series 1, Meeting Minutes, 1983-90, and <emph render="italic">Solidarity Note</emph>s, August 1987 and March 1990, in Series 2, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, 1984-90].</p><p> In the 1990s, the Solidarity Committee expanded their international efforts to include Latin America, Asia and Africa. Most notably, the Committee was involved in anti-apartheid demonstrations, boycotts, and food and clothing drives. In Latin America, the SCCD was especially interested in the problems going on in Nicaragua and El Salvador. They participated in a caravan to El Salvador that provided much-needed supplies. They also took an active interest in the role of Coca-Cola Corporation in Guatemala and the UFW's grape boycott.</p><p> A chairman, a treasurer, and a secretary performed most of the Solidarity Committee's administrative work. Subcommittees charged with coordinating various activities formed as needed. Members attended monthly meetings that were open to all, and yearly dues were contributed voluntarily by unions and individuals alike. Some special events and causes required their own fundraising efforts during the year. The SCCD also published a monthly newsletter until January 2025, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, which kept activists informed of SCCD's latest concerns. The Committee faithfully maintained its local presence, continuing an annual Martin Luther King, Jr. and Labor Day festivities that it began in Albany years ago.
 
 Following the death of longtime leader and Solidarity Notes editor John Funiciello at the end of 2024, the Solidarity Committee opted to dissolve although the members would remain committed to supporting labor and social justice.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>These records document the formation and activities of the Solidarity Committee of the Capital District (SCCD), a group of activists from New York State's capital district-area labor unions and social-reform organizations, and its links to the larger labor movement.</p><p> The collection contains minutes of all SCCD meetings held between November 1983 and May 1990; however, the minutes vary greatly in level of detail. Minutes from 2002-'03 (acquired 2005) are missing months and also vary in their level of detail. Additional administrative materials include correspondence, mailing lists, and financial records. There is also an extensive run (July 1984-February 2009) of the SCCD's monthly newsletter, <emph render="italic">Solidarity Notes</emph>, which began publication in 1984.</p><p> The bulk of the collection consists of subject files, some predating the founding of the SCCD and its predecessor organization, the Greyhound Strikers' Solidarity Committee of the Capital District. Most of the files concern labor disputes taking place in northeastern New York, but some files document strikes and other forms of protest taking place elsewhere in the United States or abroad (including Guatemala and South Africa). The files shed light upon the activities of a host of unions, including: Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Grain Millers, Aluminum, Brick, and Glass Workers International Union, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, Civil Service Employee Association, Communications Workers of America, International Association of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Ironworkers, International Association of Machinists, International Federation of Flight Attendants, International Leather Goods, Plastic, and Novelty Workers Union, International Longshoremen's Association, Laundry and Dry Cleaners International Union, National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians, Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Unions, Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, Service Employees International Union, United Auto Workers, United Farm Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers, United Mine Workers of America, United Paperworkers International Union, and United Steelworkers of America. Of particular note are copies of personal correspondence between actor and labor activist Ed Asner and SCCD chairman John Funicello.</p><p> Many of the files contain photographs, most notably, photos of Cesar Chavez and Jesse Jackson during Chavez's hunger strike in 1988 and photos of Solidarity Committee members at rallies and being arrested.</p><p> The subject files in Series 3 are divided into two alphabetical subseries. The materials in those subseries were arranged and described at two different times, several years apart, so rather than try to fit the new acquisitions into the existing subject files (which would have needed extensive rearranging and renumbering), we simply created a second series of subject files, A-Z. With that in mind, a researcher looking for information on the Albany Public Library, for instance, would want to look at both subseries for files on that topic.</p>  </scopecontent>

id="aspace_7f253601ce2435625bdc43753d995847"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries consists of photocopies of newspaper and magazine clippings, legal documents, union publications, and other materials pertaining to issues and campaigns in which the SCCD was interested in and/or involved with. Some files document the SCCD's opposition to apartheid, human-rights abuses, and corporate farming. Others detail its support for labor disputes involving a host of unions including: Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Grain Millers, Aluminum, Brick, and Glass Workers International Union, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, Civil Service Employee Association, Communications Workers of America, International Association of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Ironworkers, International Association of Machinists, International Federation of Flight Attendants, International Leather Goods, Plastic, and Novelty Workers Union, International Longshoremen's Association, Laundry and Dry Cleaners International Union, National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians, Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Unions, Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, Service Employees International Union, United Auto Workers, United Farm Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers, United Mine Workers of America, United Paperworkers International Union, and United Steelworkers of America. Of particular note are copies of personal correspondence between actor and labor activist Ed Asner and SCCD chairman John Funicello.</p><p> The material in this subseries was acquired several years after the initial subject files were created. Due to the time-intensive nature of adding them to the existing subject files, then re-numbering the folders and boxes, this second A-Z subseries was added instead. Some of the files found in this subseries contain further information about topics in Subseries #1, including James Bay/HydroQuebec, United Farm Workers, the Workers' Rights Board, General Electric, child labor, and hunger issues. Other files are new to the list, such as Korean labor unions, the National Commission for Democracy in Mexico, Earthwise Education Center, prison reform &amp; correctional officers' rights, Schenectady economic improvements, and many more. As with the first subseries, topics range from local (Albany, NY area &amp; NY State), to national, to international. Some files have just a few pages of information while others have much more, just as some contain accompanying photos while others do not.</p><p> The "Solidarity Committee 25th Anniversary" folder's main content is a DVD showing the SCCD's anniversary celebration on November 1, 2008. The DVD is 2 hours, 36 minutes in length.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_376da4f265bceeaf8dfded1b2654a7e5"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><acqinfo id="aspace_3796c0fe45af3a7340f6e9705bc78911"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Material in this subseries was acquired in and prior to 2000.
