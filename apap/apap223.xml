    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Frank Moore, a New York State politician and civil servant, held a wide range of elected and appointed positions during his fifty-year career. He served as State Comptroller from 1942 to 1950 and as Lieutenant Governor from 1951 to 1953. An expert on municipal law and finance, Moore was described by Governor Nelson Rockefeller as "the leading authority in this state, and throughout the country, on the subject of local government" [Nelson A. Rockefeller to Frank Moore, 18 July 1968, Box 20, Folder 12].</p><p>Moore was born in Toronto in 1896. Later that year his family moved to Kenmore, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo, where he graduated from high school in 1914. When the United States entered World War I Moore volunteered for the U.S. Army but was discharged from the officers' training program for being underweight. He then volunteered for the Royal Canadian Air Force, from which he later transferred to the British Royal Air Force.</p><p>Moore attended Hobart College and the University of Buffalo Law School. While studying law at Buffalo he served as clerk of the Village of Kenmore. After his admission to the bar in 1924 he established a practice in Kenmore and became counsel to the town, village and school district of that name, beginning his lifelong engagement with the problems of municipal organization in New York State. From 1927 to 1932 he served as counsel to the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on the Revision of the Town Law and was one of the principal authors of the final revision enacted in 1932.</p><p>In 1933, Moore helped establish the New York State Association of Towns and became its executive secretary. That year he also became a partner of the New York City-based firm of Dillon, Vandewater and Moore. For the rest of the decade Moore continued to practice law and to direct the Association of Towns, which issued a number of reports and sponsored a well-attended training program for town and county officers. In 1938 he served as a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention.</p><p>In 1941 Moore ran for State Comptroller in a special election following the death of the incumbent, Democrat Morris S. Tremaine, but was defeated by Tremaine's interim replacement, Joseph V. O'Leary of the American Labor Party. The following year Moore ran again for State Comptroller and was elected. He served as Comptroller from 1943 to 1950. During his time as Comptroller Moore was responsible for a number of major projects, including the equalization of state assessment rates and the Moore Commission plan to share state revenues with localities on a per capita basis.</p><p>In 1950 Moore ran for Lieutenant Governor as part of incumbent Governor Thomas Dewey's slate of Republican candidates. He was elected to the position and served until 1953. In 1953 he resigned from the position to take up the chairmanship of the Government Affairs Foundation, a foundation established by Nelson Rockefeller. He would hold this position for the next fifteen years until the dissolution of the Foundation in 1968. Concurrently with his service at the Foundation Moore served as Chairman of the Local Government Advisory Board of the Office for Local Government, an executive branch agency of New York State.</p><p>Moore holds the distinction of being one of two people to serve as a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Conventions of both 1938 and 1967 [News clipping, Box 11, Folder 12]. At the 1938 convention he served as Chairman of the Villages Committee. During the late 1950s Moore served on the Temporary State Commission on the 1959 Constitutional Convention, which was established by Governor Harriman to prepare for a possible 1959 convention. When the voters rejected the call for a convention, the commission was transformed into the Special Legislative Committee on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution, which continued to meet and issue reports.</p><p>During his career Moore chaired or served on a wide range of commissions, conferences and committees in New York State and in the United States. Moore served as chairman of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, the Committee on Constitutional Tax and Debt Limitations and City-School Fiscal Relations (CTDL-CSFR), the New York State Advisory Committee on Teachers' Salaries, the Committee on Special Local Non-Property Taxes, the New York State Temporary Commission on School Buildings, the Commission on Municipal Revenues and the Reduction of Real Estate Taxes, the State-Local Advisory Committee on Public Works, the Temporary State Commission on Per Capita Aid, and the State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York (the Moore Commission) on New York City finances. In 1955 he chaired the Finance Committee of President Eisenhower's White House Conference on Education, and in 1956 he chaired the National Conference on Metropolitan Problems. Moore was also a member of the American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods (A.C.T.I.O.N.) and a member of the Board of Overseers of the Alfred Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University.</p><p>Moore gradually retired from public service in the late 1960s for reasons of health. The Government Affairs Foundation was disbanded in 1968. Moore died in 1978 in Crystal River, Florida.</p>    <chronlist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records in this collection document Frank Moore's five-decade career as a New York State public servant. They have been arranged into ten series, plus several subseries, according to the original order of the papers and the various positions which Moore held.</p><p> The collection consists primarily of the records of Moore's service in various elected and appointed positions. Materials include correspondence, memoranda, draft and final reports, research material, periodicals, photographs, meeting minutes and news clippings. Many series contain extensive files of internal research and reports that document the statistical information which guided the decision-making of Moore and his colleagues. The records of the Committee on Constitutional Tax and Debt Limitations and City-School Fiscal Relations (CTDL-CSFR), for example, contain numerous annually issued binders of statistical information on relevant subjects, while the records of the Special Legislative Committee on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution contain extensive internal reports on the municipal government of several New York State cities. Most series also contain subject files which document the general activities of the various offices.</p><p> The collection contains extensive files of material on each of the major positions which Moore held during his career: Executive Secretary of the State Association of Towns (1933-1940), New York State Comptroller (1942-1950), New York State Lieutenant Governor (1951-1953), and Chairman of the Government Affairs Foundation (1953-1968). In addition, it contains the records of numerous conferences, commissions and committees on which Moore served, as well as records documenting his service as member and eventual Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York (1948-1965) and his participation in the 1938, 1959 and 1967 efforts to revise the New York State Constitution. Moore's activities as a prolific public speaker are documented by a large file of speeches.</p><p> Although this collection documents the majority of Moore's professional activities, some of his accomplishments are underrepresented. In particular, this collection does not document the activities of the 1959-1960 Moore Commission, which addressed New York City's fiscal problems.</p>  </scopecontent>

It includes both pamphlets published by the Association and pamphlets received from other sources. The pamphlets deal with subjects related to town law and New York State finances. They date primarily from the 1930s but include some older material, such as an 1881 pamphlet on town officer salaries (Box 2, Folder 28.) The series is organized according to the Association's organizational system, which assigned a number to each pamphlet. Note that this series is incomplete.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_80b4f2c6536af70aa659412167cd6d68" level="file"><did><unittitle>#1.

correspondence with various individuals and files related to subjects outside the scope of the Office for Local Government. Of particular note are a number of files regarding Moore's personal library (Moore was a rare book collector and donated much of his collection to various institutions), files on conservation, files on Moore's First World War service, a certificate of the legislative resolution mourning Moore's death in 1978, material regarding Moore's opposition to the New York State Lottery, extensive files of news clippings on Moore, an extensive file of photographs (beginning Box 6, Folder 21), and scrapbooks. Also of note is a collection of letters by Moore's predecessor as State Comptroller, James A. Roberts, which was presented to Moore by a rare book dealer of his acquaintance (Box 22, Folder 24.)

The series is organized alphabetically by the name of the author or issuing organization and by title when that information is not given. It includes an extensive file of New York State publications from various government divisions, mostly related to state and municipal finance, as well as numerous publications from third-party groups, such as the Institute of Assessing Officers and the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers. It also includes copies of Governor Rockefeller's messages to the legislature.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_782d29f374314734eeb08482ff953dd1" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Academic Heraldry Leaflet</emph></unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1951/1951" type="inclusive">1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_5fe612ece4646e4ded7bcb674f9b9c99" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">40 (9-Publications)</container><container id="aspace_25524de0172773490b1e43d81c788507" parent="aspace_5fe612ece4646e4ded7bcb674f9b9c99" type="Folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ae8458d07d89a10bc56d9ac982234c3f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Academy for Educational Development<emph render="italic">The Legislature and Higher Education in New York State</emph></unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1964/1964" type="inclusive">1964</unitdate><container id="aspace_5e0934584545f9c891be34d869008ed4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">40 (9-Publications)</container><container id="aspace_168419a576cf035c8487f1bd4114fb3c" parent="aspace_5e0934584545f9c891be34d869008ed4" type="Folder">16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6d462f684841ff07a642405c5cc69d41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations<emph render="italic">New Proposals for 1969: ACIR State Legislative Program</emph></unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1968/1968" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_e0fda1623a71bae0b2eea8a42fd536ee" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">40 (9-Publications)</container><container id="aspace_bc2387703d4de8f7a458f33168c27d94" parent="aspace_e0fda1623a71bae0b2eea8a42fd536ee" type="Folder">17</container></did></c><c id="aspace_011e316dbcc3d55268766d7e6a41af0d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Pamphlet</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1967/1967" type="inclusive">1967</unitdate><container id="aspace_2e5c6fc1e368666d64e9c5120b5c87ad" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">40 (9-Publications)</container><container id="aspace_8caa2ff2143c22d2923e23d76cc03dc6" parent="aspace_2e5c6fc1e368666d64e9c5120b5c87ad" type="Folder">18</container></did></c><c id="aspace_748c40e0aea4a24d4c29bb32bc656f60" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alfred P.
