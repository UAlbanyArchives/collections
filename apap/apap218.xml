    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The Schenectady Business and Professional Women's Club was federated on May 11, 1927 at what is now Schenectady County Community College. Founded on July 15, 1919, the Business and Professional Women's Club was financed through a federal grant established by the War Department to help professional women organizations. According to its vision statement it strives to be "the premier organization of women serving women...an active and inclusive club that fosters economic self-sufficiency, professional mentorship and resources, and a diverse network of members supporting each other, the community and those new to the area." There were 51 charter members, and Ella Magill Talbot served as the first president of the organization. In 1936, the Schenectady Club became incorporated into the New York State, National, and International Federations of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. </p><p>Currently the Schenectady Business and Professional Women's Club holds monthly meetings where members, "grow professionally, explore career strategies, and advocate for women regarding important social issues." The Business and Professional Women's Club also helps promote the elimination of gender discrimination in employment and equal pay. Some of the events that the Club hosts include, a fashion show, guest speakers, and a celebration of the woman of the year from their membership. The Club also offers scholarships to women who are high school seniors in Schenectady County and women over twenty-five who are returning to their studies to promote women in their pursuit to receive a higher education. </p>  </bioghist>
