    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1953, the Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television was chartered by the New York State Board of Regents as the licensee of WMHT Public Television Station and Public Radio. It was the first charter granted in New York State for an educational television council. Initial Programming was broadcast on WRGB, and later on WRTI and WROW-TV. The Council's first headquarters was a single room in Schenectady's Riverside School. In 1955, WMHT hired Donald Schein as associate producer and he led the effort for regular broadcasting that began in 1962, as Schein was elevated to general manager. An all- classical music radio station WMHT-FM began in 1972 and the Radio Information Service (RISE), a radio reading service for the blind and print handicapped in 1978. Prior to Schein's retirement in 1986, he concluded negotiations for the acquisition of Channel 45 (now WMHQ). Today, WMHT Educational Telecommunications, located in Troy, NY, is the only full-service public broadcaster serving Eastern New York and Western New England.</p>  </bioghist>
