    <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
<p>The United Steelworkers of America (USWA) AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 8652 was chartered in 1977, and was apparently the first union since the nineteenth century to represent steelworkers at the Portec Corporation, Railway Products Division, in the Rolling Mill in Troy, New York. The Rail Joint Company operated the plant before being purchased by Poor and Company, which was owned by former Rail Joint Company employee, Fred Poor, in 1929. The Troy plant was a rail joint manufacturing facility. In 1989, Portec Rail Products, Inc. closed its Troy plant and moved operations to West Virginia, thereby ending Local 8652's brief history. Additional information about Portec Corporation is available through its Web site at: http://www.portecrail.com. Accessed 7 January 2003.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes contracts from 1977 through 1989, meeting minutes from 1982, job descriptions for employees from 1980, scattered correspondence, and other materials related to union business. The closing of Portec Corporation's Troy facility is documented through the support services offered for employees by the union, a seniority list, and the shutdown agreement. The scrapbook includes photocopies of news clippings and photographs documenting union members on strike from 1986-1987 and the closing of the Portec plant in Troy.</p><p> The Hart Cluett Museum (Rensselaer County Historical Society) has records from Portec Corporation's predecessor in Troy, New York the Rail Joint Company.</p><p> For additional labor collections in the Department, see the online Labor subject guide.</p>  </scopecontent>
