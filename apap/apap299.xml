    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>P.R.O.T.E.C.T. (Prudent Residents Opposed to Electric Cable Transmission) initially formed in 1982 to oppose construction of a high voltage power line originating from Marcy, New York in Oneida County and running down to the New York City area. A volunteer organization, P.R.O.T.E.C.T. was organized into chapters, one for each county affected by the power line construction, and led by chairperson Doris Delaney of Orange County who donated the collection. The records document P.R.O.T.E.C.T.s efforts to mobilize and educate concerned citizens, and its legal actions against the Public Service Commission of the State of New York and the Power Authority of the State of New York. The papers include correspondence, newsletters, news articles, scientific papers and reports, press releases, hearing transcripts, and other legal files. For the next two decades P.R.O.T.E.C.T. remained an active advocacy organization and the subject files and background materials in the collection demonstrate its broader interests in the environmental movement. Files include materials related human exposure to electromagnetic fields, efforts to halt Hydro-Quebecs building of dams in the James Bay region of Quebec the constructions potential impact on the environment and the native people of the area, and forestry.</p>  </bioghist>
