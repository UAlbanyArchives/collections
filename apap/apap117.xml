    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Business and Professional Women's Clubs of New York (BPWNYS) was founded in April 1919 by a group of 100 women at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City led by Abbie (Gail) Laughlin. Laughlin also served as the organization's first national president. The organization's first president was Adaline Zachert of Rochester, New York. The federation was to be "not just another woman's organization," but was to become, within a quarter of a century, one of the strongest sources of unified women power in the nation.[1] Originally known as the New York State Federation of Business and Professional Women's Club, the purpose of the clubs was indicated in their constitution as: </p><p> to unite organizations of Business and Professional Women in order to come to a better knowledge and understanding of their conditions and needs in different sections of the state; to secure more equitable treatment and just recognition for women in business and the professions; [and] to gather and distribute information relative to vocational opportunities and to bring about a greater solidarity of feeling among women throughout the State.[2] </p><p> The BPWNYS has been interested in achieving its goals through both state legislation and Federal enactment. The Clubs have not only made themselves felt in their respective communities but offered programs of study and action directly related to the woman in business. Since passing the Todd bill permitting women's jury service in 1937, BPWNYS has been a leader in passing much of the nation's landmark civil and women's rights legislation including: the Equal Pay Act of 1963; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; the Women's Business Ownership Act; and more recently, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.[3] Through these, the Clubs are working on building better workplaces by focusing on equal and fair pay issues, flexible hours and parental leave, and policies for improved child and elder care.</p><p> Education has always held an important place in the Club's work. "A high school education for every girl" was one of the first goals set up to train young women for business and to help them make places for themselves in the business world.[4] Through regular meetings, BPWNYS has recognized the political, professional and personal achievements of young professional women and offered programs to provide education and guidance. Projects include the New York City Commission on the Status of Women that brings women's issues to the attention of important governmental figures, the Working Women's Clothes Closet that provides proper business attire for those who would otherwise not be able to afford business clothes, the Young Careerist Program that provides young business women and men with valuable chances to network, the Youth Leadership Program that offers workshops to high school aged girls that are designed to make them aware of available career opportunities, and Girl Scout and Business and Professional Women, a program that provides Girl Scouts with the necessary knowledge to succeed in their future careers.[5]</p>  </bioghist>

Dorothy Titchener, that tells the story of the founding of the BPWNYS, brochures and reports from "Project Buttonhole," a program designed to promote affirmative action and the handbook for the membership "Tee-Off," for recruiting new members to the BPWNYS.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_76791da941ce0b7e19ab5eb7a0ab5617" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Reports</unittitle><unitdate

id="aspace_5971181c9da183dd235f2d43901bf54e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Series 3 consists of the records of the annual legislative conference (with gaps), the BPWNYS annual conventions, and the national conferences held by the National Federation. State legislation committee members, and the hostess club's president, vice president, and chairs who attend these conferences each year create the annual legislative conference records. With a long and proud history of action and commitment, this conference continues to work together with the original idea of "women helping women," by supporting and initiating legislation to make a more equitable position for women in the job market. It encourages women to become involved in legislation so that they can gain power in political life in ways other than just supporting candidates, but by getting into the power structures of party politics.</p><p> The records of the BPWNYS annual conventions include minutes (with gaps). The voting body at the annual state convention consists of the elected officers, district directors, state standing committee chairs and the duly elected delegates of the affiliated clubs or their alternates, and past state presidents. Through a convention, the Clubs encourage the greatest possible number of members to attend, and offer an opportunity to those attending to personally meet the national representative.</p><p> The records of the national conventions that have been held by the National Federation (BPW/USA) include the minutes, financial records, and proceedings produced during the course of these conventions. The National Federation is composed of local business and professional women"s clubs from across the country.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_cd062faef55f51cae4fffdcbbaa990c1"

Contents</head><p>The Publications series consists of a Manual of Instructions for the BPWNYS (1958), Supplemental Manuals to the National Handbook of the BPW (1940, 1948), booklets on the history of the BPWNYS (1919-1994, with gaps), and magazines (1922-2001). The Supplemental Manual (to be used with the National Handbook) represented the combined efforts of a committee, providing an invaluable aid to local club presidents and committee chairs. The histories of the BPWNYS provide a chronological overview of the Clubs' activities since its inception. In this regard, the booklets of histories of BPWNYS are similar to the annual reports in series 1 due to the brief information they contain.</p><p> This series also includes a group of organizational magazines that include New York State Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs-Notes (1922), Newsletter (1933-1936), one National Business Women's Week Magazine from 1939, The New York State Business and Professional Woman (1948-1952), and NIKE (1955-2001). Particularly before the publication of NIKE in 1951, many issues of publications are missing but there are enough here to give us an interesting insight into BPWNYS. This series also contains photocopies of pages from the May 1990 issue of NIKE, which is not found in hard copy in this collection.</p><p> The group's official publications began with the New York State Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs-Notes edited by Jane J. Martin and published in July 1921. The next publication was a Newsletter edited by Miss Irene McGuire of Saratoga Springs, and the first issue of The New York State Business and Professional Woman edited by Miss Lottie Edwards and Mrs. Anne Birrell Scott of Albany and New York City was printed in magazine form with advertising in 1937. Since 1951, NIKE, the newly named state magazine, has been published. It was issued eight times a year from 1951-1954, bi-monthly from 1955-1963, and then became a quarterly magazine.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f2a80b07a290d4f416ad320676c56b8b"
