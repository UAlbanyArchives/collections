    <abstract id="aspace_a4b3cc941df5028e3ba990a71364e0d1">Dr. James "Jim" Kiepper served on the faculty in the School of Education at the University at Albany for 35 years. During the 1960s, he also was special assistant to Michigan Governor George Romney, and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller in his national bid for the U.S. Presidency in 1968. This collection documents Kiepper's long-time interest and work in politics. It includes a significant amount of memorabilia (dresses, stickers, pins, balloons, posters, fans) related to the Romney and Rockefeller presidential campaigns in 1964 and 1968. It also features Kiepper's personal notebooks from the 1964 Republican National Convention and from his work as an advance man for Rockefeller in 1968 as he traveled the country seeking a presidential bid. There also are materials from other 20th Century U.S. Presidential and Congressional political campaigns. In addition, the collection features news clips, calendars and schedules, notes, lectures and teaching materials. Kiepper is the author of Styles Bridges: Yankee Senator (2001) and previously edited the papers of Bridges and U.S. Representatives Perkins Bass and James Cleveland.</abstract>
