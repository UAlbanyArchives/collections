    <abstract id="aspace_555968eddafab34059951cfb5a20ad73">On November 14, 1946 the Carpenters' District Council of Ulster County and Vicinity was chartered. This council had local chapters in Kingston and Ellenville, New York. During the late 1940's local unions in the area began affiliating with the district council and eventually the district council, on May 4, 1949, was rechartered as the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters, the change of name more closely describing its jurisdiction. New local unions continued to be created, and independent local unions continued to affiliate with the district council. By the early 1950's the district council represented carpenters in Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Sullivan, and Ulster counties.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century local carpenter unions began to form in the Hudson Valley of New York State. The unions were split into six different district councils. The Kingston District Council of Carpenters was original founded in 1908. Since it only had two local unions, it dissolved in 1909 after the merger of the two locals. The Carpenters' District Council of Ulster County and Vicinity was formed on November 14, 1946. When this council changed its name to the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters on May 4, 1949, some local unions decided to create a separate Ulster County District Council. The Ulster County District Council was chartered on May 4, 1949 and its jurisdiction also included previous locals administered by the original Ulster County Council. The Susquehanna Valley District Council of Carpenters remained independent until May 1, 1955 when it surrendered charter to the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters. The Lower Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters also surrendered its charter to the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters on April 1, 1957. </p><p>The Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters Continued to grow in the mid-20th century. By 1974, the district had fourteen locals under its jurisdiction. The Council decided to consolidate the fourteen locals into three: Local 255 of Bloomingburg, Local 258 of Oneonta, and Local 265 of Saugerties. On June 13, 1983 the Council also established Local 245 of Oneonta for residential work.</p>  </bioghist>

Local 255 was created in 1974 when the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters merged 14 locals into three. Local 255 combined six of the 14 locals. These locals were; Local 301, Newburgh (organized July 1, 1887, chartered November 25, 1888) , Local 574, Middletown (organized May 3, 1900, chartered 1900), Local 729, Liberty (chartered April 12, 1949), Local 1038, Ellenville , Local 2373, Monticello , and Local 2967, Port Jervis (merged into Local 574). </p><p>Prior to the creation of the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters, some of these locals belogned to other district councils. Locals 301, 574, and 2967 were originally part of the Lower Hudson Valley District Council. Local 301 was chartered on November 5, 1988, Local 574 was chartered in 1900 and Local 2967's charter date is unknown. These locals were part of the Lower Hudson Valley District Council until it surrendered its charter on April 1, 1957. </p><p>Locals 729, 1038, and 2372 were originally part of the Ulster and Vicinity Council. Local 729 had jurisdiction over building and construction work in northern part of Sullivan County and was chartered on April 12, 1949. Local 1038 orignally had jurisdiction in Ellenville. Local 2372 was chartered on October 24, 1950 and had jurisdiction in Monticello. </p><p>This series contains records relating to the locals that make up Local 255. These records include meeting minutes, membership ledgers, daybooks, and contracts. While Local 1038 and Local 2372 are part of Local 255, there are no records on those specific locals in this collection. This series also contains a single ledger book of dues records remains to document the history of Local 1662.  Although the local is located in Goshen, which is near all the other unions that eventually merged into Local 255, Local 1662 is not listed in any of the tables as being a part of the predecessors.  The local might have been independent, but it is likely that it was affiliated with some predecessor to the current district council. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_62c6fd6403596c698092f50289be9bd8" level="series"><did><unittitle>Local Council 258 of Oneonta</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.2 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1900/1940" type="inclusive">1900-1940</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><arrangement id="aspace_591402f301a356fa419ae69495ad9ccc"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_e6793cca1c8fd7ec5d4333b79d36c5e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains the records of Local Council 258 of Oneonta.

Local 265 was chartered in 1974 under the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters, and was made up of five of the fourteen original locals. These locals included; Local 251, Kingston, Local 1075, Hudson, Local 1175, Kingston, Local 2161, Catskill, and Local 2328. This series also contains records of Local 306. The dues ledger of local 306  is the only surviving record of Associated Shipyard Workers Unions, Carpenters Local 306, of Kingston, N.Y.  Local 306 might have been affiliated with the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters, but whether or not this is true is unknown.  All members in this ledger are listed as being initiated in the period 1940-42, so this was likely a young local at the time. This series also contains records of Local 1560. The  record is  of the complete history of Local 1560 from its first meeting on April 14, 1903, until its last in 1909.  When Local 1560 was organized there was already one other carpenters' Local (number 251) in Kingston, N.Y.  In 1908, these two Locals formed the Kingston District Council of Carpenters, but both this council and Local 1560 dissolved in 1909 upon the merger of Local 1560 into Local 251. Local 1175 was also originally a part of the Kingston council. Locals 1075, 2161, and 2328 were originally chartered in 1955 as part of the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters. 
This series contains membership ledgers, meeting minutes, daybooks, correspondence and registers.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_98f15aa3d805c51859f3e9ab3c9f424f" level="series"><did><unittitle>Local Council 245  of Oneonta</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.2 cubic ft.</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1900/1940" type="inclusive">1900-1940</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><arrangement id="aspace_01cff0ff501c16b31072d7a03daeb597"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_97719d0248c82fc9c9a996b056070eae"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains the records of Local 245 of Oneonta which was chartered as part of the Hudson Valley District Council of Carpenters on June 13, 1983 for residental work.
