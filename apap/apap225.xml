<p>Augustus Witschief Bennet was born in New York City on October 7, 1897, the son of William Stiles Bennet, who served in the U.S. Congress from 1905-1911. Augustus Bennet attended the public schools of New York City and Washington, D.C., and graduated from Amherst College in 1918. During World War I, he served in the United States Naval Reserve Flying Corps with the rating of chief quartermaster from June 8, 1918, to January 19, 1919. He graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1921, was admitted to the bar the same year, and commenced practice in Newburgh, N.Y. </p><p>Bennet was a United States referee in bankruptcy from 1923-1944.  He initially attempted a campaign for Congress in 1942 and was subsequently elected as a Republican in 1944 to the 79th Congress.  He served January 3, 1945-January 3, 1947, but was not re-elected in 1946. Bennet then resumed the practice of law. </p><p>Bennet married Maxine Layne in 1929 and had three children.
