    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The National Audubon Society sometimes simply called Audubon is a non-profit organization. It specifically dedicates its mission to environmental conservation. Members strive to protect birds and the environments that they live in. The organization is located in the United States, where it first started in 1905. It is one of the oldest environmental conservation organizations in the world. It is called the Audubon Society after John James Audubon. He was an ornithologist and a naturalist who described, painted, and cataloged birds. He then published all of his findings in Birds of America. This book was published in sections from 1827 until 1838.</p><p>Audubon has approximately 500 local divisions. Each of these divisions is an independent non-profit that is merely affiliated to the National Audubon Society. They local divisions arrange birdwatching outings and other environmental conservation concerning trips. </p><p>Audubon, with the help of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, created an online database for bird watching called eBird. This new database helps many people who cannot be present with the organization to be able to utilize their information. On eBird, people may find new birds, share their bird sightings, and track lists of birds. This site also helps Audubon's international partners who assist birds who migrate all over the world. Some of these partners include BirdLife International, which is based in England, Bird Studies Canada, and a plethora of partners who are based in Latin America. </p><p>Audubon has agencies in New York City, and in Washington D.C., it also has state offices in 24 other states. It also operates quite a few nature centers. These centers are open to all public and are usually located in more urban settings. These locations include New York City, Phoenix, Arizona, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California.  </p><p>Audubon New York is the state program of the National Audubon Society and formerly National Audubon Society of New York State.</p>  </bioghist>
