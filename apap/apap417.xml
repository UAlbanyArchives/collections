    <head>Organizational History</head>
<p>The Historic Albany Foundation is a nonprofit organization that aims to preserve and protect buildings in the City of Albany that have architectural, historic, or civic value. Initially established in 1974 to advocate for the preservation of the Center Square and Hudson Park neighborhoods following two major construction projects in the city (Empire State Plaza and Interstate 787) which demolished a significant number of buildings, the organization today provides preservation advocacy, education, and technical assistance. The Foundation works with historic property owners, neighborhood stakeholders, private developers, elected officials and government agencies.</p>

<p>Since 1978, Foundation also has operated the Capital District's only nonprofit architectural salvage warehouse, stocking historic house parts that may be repurposed and reused.</p>
