    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Frank J. Becker was born in Brooklyn, New York on August 27, 1899 and moved with his family to Lynbrook, Long Island in 1905. He attended Brown's Business College in Jamaica, Long Island. Becker enlisted in the United States Army on July 22, 1918 and during World War I served overseas in both England and France. In the 1930s, Becker founded a real-estate and insurance company, and was chairman emeritus of the Board of Directors of the Suburbia Federal Savings and Loan Association in Garden City, Long Island. Becker was an active member in both chapters of Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion in Lynbrook in addition to being a member of the Knights of Columbus. </p><p> From 1945-1953, Becker served as a member of the New York State Assembly representing Nassau County, Long Island. Beginning in 1952, Becker acted as the delegate to the Republican National Convention and in November 1952, Becker was elected as a Republican to Congress as a New York State Representative for the 3rd District, serving portions of Nassau County. In Becker's final term from 1962-1964, congressional district lines were redrawn throughout Nassau County resulting in Becker acting as Representative of the 5th District.</p><p> During his terms in office, Becker was part of numerous committees and subcommittees including: Ways and Means Committee, Armed Services Committee (including the Subcommittee of Research and Development), Joint Legislative Committee for the Study of Military Law (specifically 1948-1953), and Charitable and Religions Societies Committee. Towards his later years in office, Becker became vocal and the focus of a debate regarding religion in schools. Becker sponsored a Constitutional amendment to allow Bible readings and organized prayer in public schools with voluntary participation. Following a Supreme Court Decision ruling prayer in school to be unconstitutional, the amendment was defeated. </p><p> Becker passed away on September 4, 1981 and is interned at Pine Law National Cemetery, Pinelawn, N.Y. Becker was survived by his wife of 58 years and his three children. One of his children, Francis X Becker was Mayor of Lynbrook and later served as a New York State Supreme Court Justice on Long Island.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The majority of the Frank J. Becker Papers span the years of 1953-1964 and document Becker's tenure in the U.S. Congress representing a portion of Nassau County, New York. There also is a 1974 oral history interview with Becker recorded by Former Members of Congress, Inc. as part of its project "The Modern Congress in American History." The collection contains materials related to his day-to-day activities including correspondence, legislative files, subject specific files, printed matter, and items related to committee work. The collection does not contain personal correspondence or information regarding Becker's time in the New York State Assembly. </p><p> The series arrangement reflects the way that Becker and his Congressional staff organized and filed his papers. The archivist also elected to retain the folder titles created by Becker and his staff. As original order is preserved, there is noticeable overlap of materials between series. Although Series 2 is entitled "Correspondence", correspondence between Becker and constituents and other representatives and department heads is found throughout the entire collection. In addition, Series 4 is entitled "<emph render="italic">Congressional Record</emph>," but there are clippings from the <emph render="italic">Congressional Record</emph> in other series. </p><p> Please note that in Series 1: Subject Files, materials of personal nature regarding some of Becker's constituents is found in a number of folders and these records are restricted.</p>  </scopecontent>

The series documents three specific groups of individuals that Becker corresponded with: Immigrants (stamped IC on the paperwork), Servicemen (stamped SM on the paperwork), and Veterans (stamped VC on the paperwork). These are only a few of many groups of people Becker interacted with. However, Becker elected to keep this correspondence separate and the archivists maintained this order. Additionally, interspersed throughout the series are copies of original public laws, a questionnaire, and newspaper clippings.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_49926626d48d72725cef3e0bbebb77a4"

and printed matter. For the majority of legislative bills through 1962, Becker's Congressional office created two files – a main file and one designated for general correspondence. News releases may be filed in either location. All the information contained in the folder titles (the legislation's date of introduction, bill number and title) appeared on the original files created by Becker's office. The series is arranged by the introduction number of the bills; however related materials in the folders may contain additional dates. Please note there is a noticeable gap with no legislative files donated for the years between 1957 and 1961.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_5119c5cbd2e03628f5d16e23690cd508" level="file"><did><unittitle>Introduced March 5, 1953, H.R. 3685, Authorizing VA Administrator to Furnish Space in Veteran Facilities, State Vet Agencies</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1953/1954" type="inclusive">1953-1954</unitdate><container id="aspace_c0c63402184e5ba9b811c48c81d238a9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (3-Legislative Files)</container><container id="aspace_4d581dda554598a8ddac6ca767864363" parent="aspace_c0c63402184e5ba9b811c48c81d238a9" type="Folder">1-2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_4d4609977d289605fb96474a98250246" level="file"><did><unittitle>Introduced March 5, 1953, H.R. 3685, Material for Presenting to Committee on Veteran Affairs</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1953/1953" type="inclusive">1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_83d4558aa274e25fc98c5d2746016922" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (3-Legislative Files)</container><container id="aspace_c53ea881079a09b95460459141d8e5e9" parent="aspace_83d4558aa274e25fc98c5d2746016922" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c6ce5bf78d7dc2c407f7ff5c350579cc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Introduced April 1, 1953, H.R. 4391, Exempt from Tax Cigarettes Sold to Veterans' Organizations for Distr.
