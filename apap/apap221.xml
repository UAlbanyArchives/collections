    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>William E. Adams was born on December 25, 1922, in Knightstown, Henry County, Indiana. Adams attended Indiana University Bloomington, which is a public research University in Bloomington, Indiana. At Bloomington, he took pre-law courses. Adams graduated with an LLB (an undergraduate law degree) from the University of Buffalo Law School. He practiced law in Buffalo, New York. He married Jacquela Devlin, and they had four children together.</p><p>Adams was a Republican and served as a member of the New York State Assembly from Erie County in the 2nd District (1957-1964) and a member of the New York State Senate (1966-1970) from the 61st (1966) and 53rd (1967-1970) Districts. </p><p>On December 12, 1969, he was accused by a federal grand jury for denying under oath that he received a bribe of $5,000. This accused bribe was from a Medicaid bill collecting company. Adams was alleged to have taken a payment of $5,000 in cash from two officers of a company that hinged on Medicaid for survival. At the trial, he said that he did not violate any laws or abuse any of his power. Adams' trial began on March 30, 1970, and he was acquitted on April 7, 1970.</p><p>He died in 1983.</p>  </bioghist>
