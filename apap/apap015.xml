    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The Civil Service Employees Association, Inc., or CSEA, is the largest public employees' union in New York State with over 265,000 members. CSEA began in Albany, New York in 1910 as a collective effort by a small group of state employees to secure better wages and working conditions. Originally known as the Association of State Civil Service Employees, the organization adopted its current name in November 1946. Between 1920 and 1940 the organization grew from a handful of workers to a membership of over 600. This increase in membership was largely based upon the admittance of non-competitive class civil service employees. By 1947 the organization admitted another class of state employees, local government workers, with the issuance of a charter to Westchester County employees.</p><p> Ever-increasing membership prompted CSEA's leadership to formalize the union. As part of this effort, CSEA purchased its first building in 1947. Along with the procurement of an organizational headquarters and the statewide issuance of charters, CSEA also published a constitution. As expressed in the CSEA constitution, the fundamental purpose of the organization is to "represent its workers with respect to all terms and conditions of employment, to uphold and extend the principles of merit and fitness in public employment, and to maintain and promote efficiency in public service and to advance the interests of all Civil Service employees." </p><p> CSEA's commitment to its members encouraged other state employees to join the union. CSEA's membership expanded to more than 40,000 by 1948. While other labor organizations discontinued operations in times of economic hardship, CSEA's membership remained active. By the 1960s the organization had become so large in number and effective that its endorsement became much sought after in the New York State political arena.</p><p> In 1967 the Taylor Law went into effect, changing the face of labor relations in New York. The Taylor Law established "good faith" collective bargaining practices for both management and labor. Furthermore, it declared all strikes by state employees illegal and prescribed a "two for one" penalty for those labor organizations whose members participated in a strike. In spite of the Taylor Law and its prohibitions against strikes by state employees, at midnight on March 31, 1972, New York State employees engaged in their first strike. The striking workers, members of CSEA, walked off their jobs to protest meager wage increases presented during contract negotiations. The strike lasted two days and resulted in contracts which included salary increases and productivity bonuses.</p><p> In 1974 CSEA "regionalized" creating six geographic subdivisions in New York. The regions are: 1) Long Island, serving Nassau and Suffolk Counties; 2) Metropolitan, serving New York City; 3) Southern, serving the seven counties of the mid-Hudson area; 4) Capital, serving the 14 counties surrounding Albany; 5) Central, serving 20 counties with Syracuse at the hub; and 6) Western, serving 14 counties extending to Buffalo and the westernmost part of the state.</p><p> In 1978 CSEA undertook a trial affiliation with the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) as Local 1000. CSEA became a permanent member of AFSCME in 1981. Currently, CSEA is the largest affiliate of AFSCME, which in turn is the largest member of the AFL-CIO.</p><p> CSEA publishes an official monthly newspaper for its members. Originally entitled <emph render="italic">The Civil Service Leader</emph>, CSEA changed the publication's name in 1978 to <emph render="italic">The Public Sector</emph>, and to <emph render="italic">The Work Force</emph> in 1998. The newspaper serves to keep members informed of the union's activities locally and statewide.</p><p> During its 100 year history, CSEA has achieved significant accomplishments. In 1920 CSEA had its first victory with the establishment of the New York State Retirement System. Throughout the 1930s, CSEA became more influential in state politics. In 1931 CSEA introduced a legislative measure that led to the 1936 abolition of the 72-hour work week for employees of state institutions. Another accomplishment of the 1930s was the passage of the Feld-Hamilton law on June 3, 1937. The new law set in place a salary plan that provided state employees with minimum salaries and equal pay for equal work. As the decade of the 1940s approached, CSEA took on a new direction. 1946 set the stage for enormous growth with the official change of the organization's name to CSEA and the constitutional change that opened up membership to all New York public employees. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, CSEA was a very influential labor union. CSEA backed the 1967 Public Employees Fair Employment Act, also known as the Taylor Law. CSEA also had a large role in the passage of the Public Employment Safety and Health Act. The new law created safer workplaces for all public employees by creating minimum safety standards. In the late 1970s, CSEA made its most dramatic move as a labor organization when it joined AFSCME. A major success of the 1980s was CSEA's constitutional change to allow the organization of private sector employees. As CSEA approached and entered the new millennium, it realized that it would be faced with new challenges as it advocated for workers' rights, including a growing pool of retirees. After several years of fighting for a permanent cost of living adjustment (COLA) to the pension system, CSEA utilized the union's influential power to obtain the benefit in 2000. Today CSEA continues to serve as an advocate for workers, bargaining for just contracts and campaigning for quality and affordable health care, education, safe workplaces, and guaranteed Social Security benefits.</p><p> Following is a list of CSEA Presidents from the organization's founding through today:</p><p> William M.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the Civil Service Employees Association span from 1918 to the present. There is no documentation of the organization's initial years of existence. The records include Meetings, Records of Resolution or Motion, Legal and Administrative Files, Subject Files, Publications, News Clippings, Press Releases, Audio Visuals, Scrapbooks, records of the CSEA 100 Project, an extensive interview project created to help celebrate the union's centennial in 2010, Photographs, and Membership. Of these, publications is the largest series and includes CSEA's official newspapers <emph render="italic">The Civil Service Leader</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Public Sector</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Work Force</emph>. Please note that the records of the Capital City Council of the Civil Service Association, which formed in 1918, are also included in Series 1, Subseries 1: Board of Directors Meetings. </p><p> The collection contains a variety of record formats. A selection of early to mid-twentieth century meeting transcripts and publications are housed on microfilm, some filmed by CSEA and others by the M. E. Grenander Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives. There is a substantial number of paper files including correspondence, newspapers, meeting and interview transcripts (also digitized), meeting minutes, and subject files, and both hard copy and digitized publications and photographs. In addition, there are video and audio tapes and scrapbooks. There are a small number of born digital materials.</p><p> Conspicuously absent from the collection is any documentation of the strike in 1972 by CSEA members, except for any discussions in the minutes and transcripts of meetings. While only lasting two days, it is noted in New York labor history for being the first strike by state employees under the Taylor Law of 1967, which made it illegal for New York State employees to strike and imposed harsh financial penalties for those who did.</p>  </scopecontent>

proposals made at various organizational meetings between 1961 and 1966. Although the majority of the records are from one decade, there is a considerable amount of information within the series as the issues raised during the meetings varied widely. This information could be used to study the organization's development during the 1960s as that time period saw radical changes in New York State labor policy.</p></scopecontent><c

These records include the agreements between CSEA and New York State and its various units, collective bargaining agreements, and the meeting minutes of the Legal Committee. The reels also include model constitutions and by-laws, department head minutes and reports, and Political Action Fund meeting information.</p><p> The paper portion of the Legal and Administrative Files series also consists of agreements between CSEA and New York State and its various units, and materials pertaining to the Public Employee Federation (PEF) challenge. In the 1970s PEF challenged CSEA for sole representation of state employees in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Unit. Included are memorandums, case materials, court decisions, press releases, and news clippings. The paper portion also features material that spans the entire scope of the legal and administrative aspects of CSEA, including files from the Suffolk County Chapter, the Committee on Revision of Constitution and By-Laws, and material from the Council 82 strike of 1979-1980.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_583ae84bd108598039b3928126bc5858" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agreements Between CSEA

and speeches. Press releases, though incomplete, cover a broad range of topics from key issues to notification of meetings. The press releases are produced by CSEA and distributed in a paper format and posted on the CSEA website. The weekly summaries, also known as "Hot Sheets," are summary memos outlining the activities of the various CSEA departments for that week. They were distributed internally and offer a glimpse into the week to week work undertaken by the CSEA. The statements/speeches were made by CSEA leadership and officers regarding the union's position on key issues.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_aff30cc40fde48cf3f12950412217515"
