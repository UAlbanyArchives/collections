    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Judith Evelyn "Jude" Filler was born in Ohio in 1949, graduated Antioch College, and received her MBA from Simmons College. During a later move to Texas for her career in business, she became a volunteer for Amnesty International. Filler subsequently served as Amnesty's state coordinator against capital punishment and become executive director of the Texas Alliance for Human Needs, a coalition of grassroots groups seeking social justice and change. In addition, she was a member of Friends Meeting of Austin and highly involved in the community for many years. </p>

<p>As part of Filler's work on the Death Penalty, she visited and corresponded with individuals incarcerated on Death Row. One of those individuals was David Lee Powell, convicted in a 1978 murder of a police officer. Powell remained on Death Row for 32 years until his execution in 2010. As she sought to abolish capital punishment, Filler and Powell became friends. </p>

<p>Following an extended battle with cancer, Filler died in 2016. </p>
