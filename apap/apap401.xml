    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Kentucky Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (KCADP) seeks to end capital punishment in Kentucky through education, outreach, coalition-building, and grassroots organizing.</p>

<p>The KCADP has its roots in two other organizations - the Louisville chapter of the Southern Coalition on Jails and Prisons, established in 1976 and which thrived for about a decade, and the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union which provided an organizing foundation for the KCADP beginning in 1984.</p>

<p>A state steering committee formed in 1986, the KCADP began to distribute newsletters in 1987, and the organization was formally incorporated in 1988.</p>
