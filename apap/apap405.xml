    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Gregory Joseph Bardacke was born in 1912 in Harbin, China, the second child of Joseph and Anya Bardacke. His parents, both Jewish, were Russian speakers from Ukraine and Lithuania respectively, and Bardacke spoke only Russian until he attended school in Canada (where the family had moved when he was about a year old) at age five. The family immigrated to the United States in 1921. Bardacke graduated from high school in New Jersey and attended Syracuse University on a football scholarship (though he only played for Syracuse for one year, choosing to play semi-pro as he needed the money for rent and food). Thus, although he earned a degree (in Chemistry), he was not actually awarded the degree as the University claimed he owed money for tuition.</p>

<p>Bardacke began working as an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (I.L.G.W.U) in early 1937 Herkimer, New York hoping to organize the employees of the Derby Sportswear factory to form a union. In August 1937, some employees at the factory went on strike. During the strike, Bardacke was arrested and indicted several times for defending the young female workers, but he was never convicted. After leaving the I.L.G.W.U., Bardacke worked for the Hatters Union in Connecticut. </p>

<p>In January 1939, Bardacke married Beatrice Schonberg, another labor organizer. Although both he and his wife had earlier been members of the Socialist Party, when Hitler invaded Poland, they quickly joined the Democratic Party and Bardacke raised money from workers in labor unions. The two remained committed Democrats their entire lives. Before World War II ended, Bardacke took a job with the War Production Board in Washington D.C., working with labor unions to support the war effort.</p>

<p>In 1947, Bardacke was appointed the labor representative to the United Nations Appeal for Children (later UNICEF). In 1953, he began working as the Executive Director of the Histadrut, the Israeli Labor Federation, out of its New York office. Bardacke worked there, connecting the leadership of American labor unions with their counterparts in Israel, for the rest of his working career.</p> 

<p>Bardacke died in 1991, survived by three daughters.</p>
