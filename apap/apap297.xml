<p>Major Owens was a U.S. Representative from New York. A Democrat, he represented New Yorks 11th Congressional District (which encompasses a number of Brooklyn neighborhoods) from 1982 until his retirement in 2006. A librarian by profession, he served as community coordinator of the Brooklyn Public Library from 1964 to 1966 and as director of Columbia University's Community Media Library Program from 1973 to 1975. During the 1960s and 1970s Owens also was involved in a number of civil rights and community groups in New York City, including the Brooklyn Congress of Racial Equality, the Metropolitan Council on Housing, and the Brownsville Community Council. In 1974, Owens was elected to the New York State Senate, where he served until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>  </bioghist>
