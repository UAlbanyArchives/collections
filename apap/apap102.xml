    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Helen Quirini (1920-2010) was a lifelong resident of Schenectady, New York. She was known for her dedication to numerous causes, such as organized labor, the YWCA of Schenectady, gender and racial equality, social welfare, and local activism. Although Quirini focused primarily on the Capital Region, she also worked for statewide and national causes. She advocated the repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 and participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. During her 39 year employment at General Electric (GE) and her 30 year retirement, Quirini advocated for the better treatment of employees and retirees by the management of GE.</p><p> Born March 9, 1920 to Marie Ogonowski and Frank K. Quirini, Helen Quirini was the youngest of four children and attended Mont Pleasant High School. On April 1, 1941, at the age of 21, Quirini began working for GE's Schenectady plant doing piece work in the factory. The United States' entrance into World War II interrupted her initial plan to save money in order to attend college. Quirini decided to work at GE throughout the war as a service to her country. By 1945 she had established a pattern of union leadership and community activism that continued for the rest of her life.</p><p> At General Electric she joined the Athletic Board, advocated for equal treatment for female employees and organized drives for the local Red Cross. She joined a union, Local 301, which was first affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE) and later, beginning in 1954, with the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE). Quirini held many executive leadership positions with Local 301, served on numerous labor committees, was a union shop steward and regularly attended union conferences and conventions. Quirini was a vocal force for employee rights, both in boardroom meetings with GE executives and during strikes, protests and work stoppages. In 1953 Quirini mobilized mass protests to advocate for equal pay for women workers at GE. She walked picket lines in all types of weather in support of union solidarity. While employed at GE and as a member of Local 301, Quirini achieved a number of firsts. In 1953, she became the first woman elected chairperson of the special UE-GE Conference Board Meeting, held that year in Chicago. Quirini also was the first woman and hourly representative elected chairperson of the GE Employees Share Fund in 1975.</p><p> Quirini was accused of Communist Party affiliation during the McCarthy era because of her union advocacy. She received a subpoena and testified in a pre-hearing that she was not a proponent of Communism, but sought equal rights for all individuals. She testified that she had attended a Communist meeting, and even mentioned seeing "company men" from General Electric there. The case against her was dropped. Quirini filed a Freedom of Information Act request decades later to review the documents held by the FBI from the McCarthy era. Redacted copies of the completed request are available in Series 2.</p><p> After her retirement from General Electric in 1980, Quirini became well known for her attempts to win greater benefits for GE retirees through advocacy, shareholder proposals and her annual speech at the GE shareholders meeting. Always wearing a bright T-shirt with the words "GE Brings Good Things to Retirees, Please" Quirini, along with other retirees and their supporters, frequently picketed at General Electric in Schenectady and at the annual shareholder meetings. She served as president of Local 301 Retirees Council and co-founded the GE Retirees Justice Fund. Her highly visible role at shareholder meetings brought her to the attention of Jack Welch, the chairman and CEO of General Electric from 1981-2001. Local playwright Gail George wrote a one-woman play about Quirini's relationship with Welch entitled <emph render="italic">Helen and Jack.</emph></p><p> During her employment for GE, Quirini volunteered for non-union related causes. She joined the YWCA of Schenectady in 1943 and eventually became its president. Through her United Way work with Local 301, she began working with the Refreshing Springs Child Day Care alongside her friend Reverend Georgetta Dix in 1970, where her varied executive duties lasted until 1987.</p><p> Quirini continued her activism during her retirement by volunteering for the rights and benefits of seniors and community causes in Schenectady County. She was a member or director of a wide variety of civic and labor organizations, including: the American Association of Retired Persons Chapter 490, Better Neighborhoods Inc., Citizens for Preservation and Revitalization, Human Services Planning Council's Aging Committee, IUE Local 301 Retirees Council, New York State Wide Senior Action Council, Schenectady Council of Senior Citizens, Schenectady County Committee on Health Care Issues, Schenectady County Council of Child Day Care Centers, and Schenectady County Human Rights Commission.</p><p> Quirini also was the recipient of many awards. She received the United Way Joseph A. Beirne Award, the YWCA of Schenectady Jefferson Award and the General Electric Gerald L. Phillippe Award. She also received the Patroon award, the highest honor given by the City of Schenectady. Series 1 contains many more awards and related material.</p><p> Selections from <archref linktype="simple" href="http://www.albany.edu/history/histmedia/Hq.html" actuate="onrequest" show="new"><emph render="italic">Helen Quirini and General Electric: A Personal Memoir of World War II</emph></archref> are made available online through the University at Albany Department of History's History and Media Initiatives website and a copy of the full memoir is found in Series 1.</p><p> Quirini also appeared in other publications about unions, women and community activists. Her work for GE retirees garnered her and the pension cause coverage in major newspapers and magazines across the country. In the 1990s, the Schenectady General Electric in the 20th Century Project extensively interviewed Quirini and different periods of her life are documented in articles and student research papers, many of which are available in the collection.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection documents the life, work and activism of Helen Quirini of Schenectady, New York. The collection represents Quirini's numerous activities and interests including her early work owning a local market with her brother, her 39 year employment for General Electric, her activism in unions during her employment and retirement, as well as her charitable activities where she pursued civil, housing, pension, women's and senior citizen's rights. </p><p> The M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives received this collection through multiple donations. Helen Quirini donated material over approximately 10 years and her nephew Rudy Quirini donated the final materials following Helen Quirini's death in 2010. Many of the papers lacked original order and therefore archivists needed to impose order throughout the collection. Archivists created the series structure to represent Quirini's personal life, employment, labor union work and activism. She held many executive board positions after her retirement and remained an active volunteer and labor rights activist until her death. There is occasional overlap between topics and series such as senior citizens (Series 6, Subseries 5) and pension rights (found in General Electric Series 5). </p><p> Quirini spent nearly her entire life in Schenectady, New York. This collection offers a perspective into industrial work during World War II and the life of a female union activist in the mid-20th Century through photographs, diary entries, labor union literature, grievance reports Quirini filed and labor union convention materials. The collection documents the workings of various local organizations through meeting minutes, budgets, correspondence, publications, by-laws, treasurer's reports and other internal documents. Quirini also worked for local chapters of larger organizations. Quirini was active in her local community and corresponded with State and National legislators about a variety of topics, including day care services, labor unions, local government, Schenectady County development, senior citizens' issues and more. </p><p> Quirini maintained extensive subject files with clippings, articles, photographs and reports. Also available are collections of publications and newsletters from relevant organizations, such as UE and IUE publications and the New York State Wide Senior Action Council's newsletter. </p><p> The audiovisual portion of this collection includes audio and video cassettes, DVDs, CDs, reel-to-reel tapes, 8mm film and 45 RPM record singles.</p><p> Please note that not all dates are inclusive.</p><p> Related collections in the Department of Special Collections and Archives include the records of IUE-CWA Local 301 (APAP-023), Ralph Boyd Papers (APAP-165, Helen Quirini's friend and fellow advocate for the rights of GE Retirees), Associated Industries of New York State, Inc. (APAP-043) , and the New York State Wide Senior Action Council (APAP-111). Issues of the newspapers of Local 301 are available in microfilm, paper, and electronic format in the records of IUE-CWA Local 301 (APAP-023) including special Local 301 publications from the 1966 and 1969 strikes.</p><p> Quirini deposited various materials at other repositories including the: Schenectady Public Library (material related to Georgetta Dix) and the NYU Tamiment Libraries and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives. Her nephew Rudolph Quirini also donated materials to the Grems-Doolittle Library at the Schenectady County Historical Society.</p><p> Reproductions of items from this collection are available in the exhibit <archref linktype="simple" href="http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/documentinglabor/" actuate="onrequest" show="new">Documenting Labor Inside and Out: Labor History in New York State's Capital District</archref>.</p>  </scopecontent>

Contents</head><p>This series documents Helen Quirini's extensive union activities through her membership in Local 301. When Quirini joined this local it was affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE). During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the federal government kept UE leadership and its members under surveillance because of suspected Communist ties. In his aggressive investigations of accused Communists, Senator Joseph McCarthy, chairman of the Committee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations, subpoenaed Quirini and she was one of many members of the UE to testify in a pre-hearing before Congress in February 1954. She swore under oath that she was not and had never been a member of the Communist Party. Citing these supposed Communist connections, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) expelled the UE in 1949 and replaced it with the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE). During subsequent years many UE locals elected to join the IUE, including Local 301 in June 1954. This series features materials related to all of the aforementioned events, including Quirini's subpoena, anti-McCarthy literature issued by unions, Quirini's surveillance files and a significant amount of propaganda from both unions issued before Local 301's vote to join the IUE.</p><p> Quirini was very outspoken about issues affecting business and politics. During the UE/IUE switch, she was the only executive board member of Local 301 to oppose the move. A personal statement in the files explains her reasoning and disappointment with her subsequent treatment from fellow members of Local 301. Her many grievances in this series illustrate her advocacy for greater equality for women in the workplace and better working conditions for all employees. She retained many news clippings and materials discussing strikes she participated in at General Electric in the late 1960s and 1970.</p><p> Quirini served her union during both the UE and IUE periods in many capacities, the extent of which is documented in this series through correspondence, reports, financials and other Local 301 business documents, conference proceedings, contracts, election campaign materials, newspaper clippings, photographs and notes. She held elected positions in Local 301 from the 1940s through the 1970s. Quirini was first elected secretary in 1947, and later served as treasurer and a shop steward. Her committee work included service on the social action, education and human relations committees. She attended union meetings and conferences and played for Local 301 women's basketball and championship softball teams when a young woman.</p><p> In addition to her direct union involvement, Quirini engaged in several related projects. As an active and then a retired member of Local 301, she was a delegate to the Schenectady Area Central Labor Council and attended meetings. In addition to meeting minutes, reports and correspondence, there are papers documenting the education program about labor for Schenectady public schools that Quirini created as chair of the Council's education committee, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. </p><p> As a labor representative, Quirini also served on the Schenectady Private Industry Council (PIC), part of the Capital Area PIC and was active from 1981 through 1993. The related files in this series record the organization's duties under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982. The organization tried to implement JPTA through coordination and planning with business (small, large, minority), labor, and other concerned groups and ultimately provide employment and training for displaced or underprivileged job seekers and research and job-ready employees to private industry. PIC files include the internal documents of the Capital Region and Schenectady County PIC, such as meeting minutes, proposals, memorandums and correspondence, as well as documents relating directly to the JTPA legislation.</p><p> Researchers also will find general labor literature from the AFL-CIO, UE, IUE and other organizations in the series.</p><p> Please see Series 3 for more specific information on women's rights and representation in the workplace and the union and Series 5 for materials detailing Quirini's ongoing efforts to secure better rights and cost-of-living allowances for GE retirees, including those from Local 301. Researchers also should consult the finding aid for Local 301's records, APAP-023.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_c009245f0be5327feff16f8db05ac322" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph

It contains significant materials, including correspondence, agendas, resolutions and news clippings, about UE and IUE women's conferences (both national and regional), educational programs and committees. Helen Quirini attended and spoke at many of these events and her handwritten notes are often included among the materials. Subject files discuss such topics as equal pay for equal work, automation, pay rates and the Equal Rights Amendment. There are files with records from speaking events featuring Quirini, Quirini's notes from the shop floor on the treatment of women and her later writings about the discrimination she encountered at General Electric as a female employee. In addition, there is UE, IUE, AFL-CIO and U.S. Department of Labor literature on women workers collected by Quirini. </p><p> Quirini was active in the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW).

Electric, especially its operations in Schenectady where Helen Quirini worked from 1941 until 1980. There are files related to GE's corporate and administrative operations, such as annual reports and benefits information, materials illustrating Quirini's participation in the GE Athletic Association and her work with the Share Fund, and a scrapbook created by Quirini of the history of GE in Schenectady. Of interest to researchers may be files addressing work at GE during World War II, materials from the GE Apprentice Alumni Association and publications issued by GE.</p><p> A significant number of files discuss GE retirees and their fights to secure better pensions, especially cost-of-living allowances. As a president and member of the Local 301 Retirees Council and a founding member of the GE Retirees Justice Fund, Quirini was active and extremely outspoken for the rights of retirees during the last 30 years of her life. This series documents her efforts in this fight, including picketing at GE offices and annual meetings, organizing rallies, introducing shareholder proposals and addressing GE executives at the annual meeting, corresponding with Jack Welch and Jeffrey Immelt during their respective tenures as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of GE and conducting media outreach. As a result, she was featured in many news articles and playwright Gail George created a one woman show in 1999 about Quirini's struggles for retiree rights with GE management, entitled Helen and Jack. There are several folders about the play Helen and Jack. Correspondence documenting Quirini's friendship with George as well as video of George's performances also are in the series.</p><p> This series features correspondence, news clippings, photographs, subject files, pamphlets, pay stubs, reports, background materials, manuals, speeches, audio/video, news releases and media advisories.</p><p> Please see Series 2 and 3 for more information about Quirini's labor union experiences while working at GE.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_808a186c09714123b92760e4c7c5e75a" level="file"><did><unittitle>2 Day Strike over Health</unittitle><unitdate normal="2003/2003" type="inclusive">2003</unitdate><container id="aspace_326b8d4205981f23796b8a42b998fbd0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (5-General Electric)</container><container id="aspace_b6d51ecd88664ab895dc004997bfc117" parent="aspace_326b8d4205981f23796b8a42b998fbd0" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_3cdf7b1aac41d8da7a90df8c1dfb2a96" level="file"><did><unittitle>13th Pension Check</unittitle><unitdate normal="2003/2003" type="inclusive">2003</unitdate><container id="aspace_3f7a6d83e673b8937b738a1bedf3e29a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (5-General Electric)</container><container id="aspace_9f12e5fefe3ff12b145203d3fc8c9a88" parent="aspace_3f7a6d83e673b8937b738a1bedf3e29a" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7f9a3d8d64368524d1ee8b4476abb4c3" level="file"><did><unittitle>40th Anniversary Celebration, Schenectady Works Apprentice Alumni Association</unittitle><unitdate normal="1941/1941" type="inclusive">1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_4aa1917f1dfd5486fee33ab09cbb1b29" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (5-General Electric)</container><container id="aspace_6bc7df2fccb939aab2d1af67e5b67545" parent="aspace_4aa1917f1dfd5486fee33ab09cbb1b29" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_053f6b8fdaae88360239ddb475d65e39" level="file"><did><unittitle>60th Anniversary Celebration, Schenectady GE Apprentice Alumni Association</unittitle><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973</unitdate><container id="aspace_9faf378e6461c29cd7983485deeb3466" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (5-General Electric)</container><container id="aspace_fe81b88d28b740454955931e9f680f78" parent="aspace_9faf378e6461c29cd7983485deeb3466" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c6e93b3e432c5377d1e51fc94f2bbf1d" level="file"><did><unittitle>70th Anniversary Celebration, Schenectady GE Apprentice Alumni Association</unittitle><unitdate normal="1983/1983" type="inclusive">1983</unitdate><container id="aspace_424e6e5908a115812c51ff54a10df048" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (5-General Electric)</container><container id="aspace_cc4afe8fd9013f387d674f7b7b9c73d5" parent="aspace_424e6e5908a115812c51ff54a10df048" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_1961aea2cd4c8e5bafb8cf331fe0915e" level="file"><did><unittitle>A.C.

She went on to serve on the board of directors and was elected president in 1979. This subseries contains materials illustrating the YWCA's day-to-day activities and its contributions to the community. The subseries consists of agendas, minutes, newsletters, magazines and flyers.

She originally represented labor on the Child Care Coordinating Council during World War II. She chaired the Schenectady County Child Care Council and was also a board member of the New York State Child Care Coordinating Council. She worked directly with day care centers such as the Christ Church Day Care center and the Refreshing Springs Day Care where she was an administrator alongside her longtime friend Reverend Georgetta Dix, who founded and ran the center. </p><p> Subseries 3 includes administrative materials like internal correspondence, budget material, clippings, frequent correspondence with the Schenectady Department of Social Services' Commissioner Richard Staszak, informational packets, proposed legislation and meeting minutes from multiple organizations, including the Schenectady Child Care Council, Schenectady Day Care Council and the Early Childhood Task Force. Budget and financing information is the primary focus of the internal documents including Title XX and other State or Federal funding institutions. Information regarding establishing or finding a day care center, funding and entitlement, event programs, transcripts of spoken testimonies and conference materials are also present in this subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_04882ffbcc718ca4e562d8a64e524656" level="file"><did><unittitle>Antos, Susan- Correspondence with Greater Upstate Law Project, Survey Forms, Schenectady Child

Schenectady County. Some materials were gathered by Helen Quirini in response to development plans by the Metroplex Development Authority in Schenectady County, Industrial Development Agencies (IDA) and Schenectady Economic Development Corporation (SEDC). Metroplex was created in 1998 to coordinate economic development activities. Several of Metroplex's proposals met with resistance from the public, including the proposal to tear down the Gazette Building on State and Broadway and replace it with a new Department of Transportation office building. Quirini, with others from Preserve Schenectady's Future, filed a lawsuit to save the Gazette Building. Citizens for Preservation and Revitalization (CPR) and the March 19th Coalition were organizations formed in opposition to Metroplex and its proposals. In 2002, the Glenville Energy Park was proposed and Citizens Advocating Responsible Development (CARD) petitioned against it. Quirini gathered other materials as part of activities with consumer advocacy groups. She joined Better Neighborhoods Inc. in 1971, was elected to the board in 1981 and served as president from 1984-1986. She also served on the Consumer Advisory Council of Niagara Mohawk in the late 1980s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_7e3212f3b86a1dea04dda74afc6e4592" level="file"><did><unittitle>Better

organizations for senior citizens on local, statewide and national levels. In addition to work on behalf of the GE Retirees, she served for many years as president of Chapter 490 (Schenectady County) of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and as president of the Schenectady County Council of Senior Organizations. The files contain meeting minutes, events materials, financial records, correspondence, newsletters and petitions from these two groups.</p><p> Her participation in the Schenectady County Council of Senior Organizations led in 1987 to her involvement with the StateWide Senior Action Council. Quirini served as an at-large board member and later as treasurer of StateWide. She received the Rose Kryzak Advocacy Award as a leader on public policy issues, both locally and statewide. A grassroots organization composed of individual senior citizens and senior citizen clubs from across New York, StateWide is involved in legislative issues and campaigned against Medicare cuts and mandatory retirements. The group fought for pharmaceutical insurance for the elderly, assistance for seniors with utility payments and greater protection of hospital patient rights. The files reflect StateWide’s advocacy activities and feature testimony, including Quirini’s, before legislative panels and materials from an annual Grassroots Senior Citizens Day which encouraged seniors to come to Albany to meet with elected representatives. There also are board meeting minutes, correspondence, convention booklets and materials from Quirini’s local chapter of the organization.</p><p> Quirini also joined the Public Service Commission’s Albany Area Senior Citizen Advisory Council in the mid-1980s. This group advised on customer expectations and utility needs from a senior’s perspective. One of key recurring issues was the increasing costs of telephone service. In 1992 this Advisory Council joined with other special needs consumer groups to form the Public Service Commission’s Capital District Utility Consumer Advisory Council. Quirini remained on this newly formed Council until at least 1993. Agendas, meeting minutes, notes, correspondence and reports from Quirini’s tenure on both Councils are present. </p><p> In addition to her work with area organizations, Quirini also became involved in national issues most relevant to seniors. Qurini fought for the repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 which she argued had modest benefits and would burden elder Medicare recipients with extra costs and taxes. Qurini chaired mass informational meetings of area seniors groups to discuss the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in 1988 and 1989. These featured state and local legislators, individual seniors and leaders of senior citizen groups as speakers. Notes, speeches, photographs and flyers from these events and general background materials about the legislation are in this series. </p><p> The IUE nominated Quirini to attend the New York State Governor’s Conference on Aging in March 1995. She subsequently served as part of the New York delegation to the White House Conference on Aging held in May 1995. This series features materials from both conferences, including official reports and resolutions as well as Quirini’s correspondence and notes. </p><p> Other items of interest in this series are pamphlets written by Quirini on a variety of issues affecting seniors and materials about the Social Security Notch provision which affected benefits paid to individuals, like Quirini, born between 1917 and 1921.</p><p> Please see Series 5 for materials related to Quirini's work with the GE Retirees on behalf of pension reform.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_afaf3b42c3ab00e7beb9c05155c26a84"

Contents</head><p>This subseries is composed of materials produced and collected by Helen Quirini during her work with a number of organizations on the issues of health care and health care reform. It features correspondence, news clippings, publications, meeting agendas and minutes, reports and subject files. One organization documented in this subseries is the Health Systems Agency of Northeastern New York (HSA/NENY). Quirini served on its board of directors for many years beginning in the late 1970s. Established by Congress during the Gerald Ford administration, HSA/NENY was one of eight agencies in New York created to control rising health care costs. The materials for HSA/NENY were frequently shipped in bundles in preparation for upcoming meetings and much of the material in this subseries has been maintained in that order. Other organizations documented in the subseries include the Schenectady County Committee on Health Care Issues, an advocacy organization for quality regional health care, and the Health Care Action Line, a help line started to assist people with questions about health care reach trained volunteers. The Berger Commission's recommendations to reform and restructure New York's health care became legal mandates on January 1, 2007. In Schenectady, St. Clare's Hospital, Bellevue Woman's Hospital, and Ellis Hospital were restructured or merged as a result. Quirini was very active in seeking to maintain high quality care in the community. </p><p> Please see Series 6, Subseries 5 for more information about senior citizens and health care.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2249c82f86e81e56162374b39f855cf7" level="file"><did><unittitle>AARP, "A Case for Comprehensive Health Care Reform: The Costs of Doing
