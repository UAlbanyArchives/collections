    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Since 1951 the Bethlehem Business Women's (BBW) Club has been composed of women who live or work in the Town of Bethlehem, New York. The bBW offers an opportunity for its members meet, network, and support the town through various community activities.  Originally chartered as The Bethlehem Business and Professional Women's Club and a charter member of the New York Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, the BBW broke away from the Federation in 1960 believing its money would be better spent within the Bethlehem community.</p><p>Today the BBW is comprised of local women of all ages with diverse backgrounds and interests. The Club provides college scholarships to graduating high school seniors who reside in the Town of Bethlehem and who have shown both academic achievement and community service during their high school years. Other community services activites include contributions to the local food pantry, participation in the Adopt-a-Highway program, and supportint the local annual Holiday Community Dinner.</p>  </bioghist>
