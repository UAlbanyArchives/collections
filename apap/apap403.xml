<p>Founded in 1993, New York Friends of Midwives was formerly the largest consumer advocacy organization for midwifery in the state. Through advocacy work, educational and public outreach, and political activities, the organization provided information about midwifery care and birthing alternatives; supported the independent role of midwives; and worked with and challenged the State Board of Midwifery about licensing protocols and education for direct entry midwives.</p>  </bioghist>
