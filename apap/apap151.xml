    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>In 1989, Tracy Frisch, an etymologist who had suffered from pesticide poisoning, formed a non-profit citizens' organization called the New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides (NYCAP). Its mission was primarily to reduce the use of hazardous chemical pesticides through education and advocacy ["NYCAP", Series 1, Box 2, Folder 32].</p><p> The early issues that NYCAP championed included the following: safe pest control for schools, hospitals, and public places; reducing work exposure to chemicals; farm worker protection; prevention of groundwater pollution; environmentally sound farming; and strict regulation of pesticides. NYCAP also sought to provide leadership on these issues to other organizations such as parent teacher associations, labor unions, and general environmental groups. To achieve these goals, two major projects were set up: the School Campaign and the Occupational Health and Workers Rights Projects. Both sought to develop legislation on pesticide alternatives and educate farmers on sustainable agriculture ["NYCAP Welcomes You!" <emph render="italic">NYCAP News</emph>, vol. 1, no. 1 (1989), p. 1, Series 6, Box 3, Folder 29].</p><p> One of the organization's first activities was to publish <emph render="italic">NYCAP News</emph>, a quarterly newsletter that contained personal stories of members, legislative news, information on pesticide issues, the newest staff and organization news, and upcoming events. The publication was small in the beginning but grew to over thirty pages. It eventually changed its name to <emph render="italic">Solutions</emph> with the spring 1996 issue.</p><p> In accomplishing its mission, conferences, workshops, training courses, and a mail order clearinghouse were used to spread information on subjects such as school and workplace integrated pest management, household pest control, organic farming and gardening, multiple chemical sensitivity, workers' rights, and sustainable agriculture ["NYCAP", Series 1, Box 2, Folder 32]. These programs extended all over New York State, with similar conferences held in the Capital Region, Western New York, Long Island, and Central New York. NYCAP was known for its work on integrated pest management, participation in the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee on Safe Housing, as well as its commitment to spreading awareness of multiple chemical sensitivity.</p><p> Tracy Frisch was the first executive director and editor of the newsletter, staying with NYCAP until mid-1995 [<emph render="italic">NYCAP News</emph>, vol. 5, no. 3 (1995), p. 2, Series 6, Box 3, Folder 31]. Marilyn DuBois served as interim director until James Moore took over in late 1995 [Correspondence, Series 1, Box 1, Folder 33]. Pamela Hadad-Hurst succeeded Moore and remained executive director until the organization's demise in 2003.</p><p> NYCAP's primary area of service was the east coast, but it did have membership nationwide [Gabrielle Blake. New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides, (NYCAP) (online). Troy, N.Y.: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (9 March 2004) Available from the World Wide Web (http://www.rpi.edu/</p><p> interns/work/internships/Environment/NYCAP.html) (File Not Found 20 February 2006)]. By 2003, NYCAP was run by a staff of three people, an executive director, an information director, and a staff person at the Western New York branch of NYCAP that opened in May 2002 [New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides. WNY Region (online). Albany, N.Y.: New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides (10 March 2004) Available from the World Wide Web (http://www.altpest.org/) (File Not Found prior to 20 February 2006)]. NYCAP was governed by a Board of Directors, and a Steering Committee made up of members of other environmental groups, both national and regional [<emph render="italic">NYCAP News</emph>, vol. 1, no. 3 (1990), p. 2, Series 6, Box 3, Folder 29].</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection documents the activities of the New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides (NYCAP) from its creation in 1989 through its demise in 2003. The organization was formed as a not-for-profit group devoted to educating the public about pesticides and other environmental dangers. It was able to spread its message through conferences, workshops, mail order catalogs, information requests, school programs, and contributions to policy-making.</p><p> The collection consists of administrative files such as committee and meeting minutes, fundraising campaigns, by-laws, correspondence, annual telemarketing campaigns, grant proposals and funding, invoices, prepaid sales receipts, and technical assistance logs. Mailing and membership lists for NYCAP and some related organizations are also included in this collection, along with state and national legislation; government reports and publications; conference planning, programs, and attendance lists; information requests, news clippings and journal articles on pesticide-related topics; pesticide fact sheets; brochures and pamphlets; pesticide labels; and copies of newsletters, magazines, journals, and other publications of related groups received through a newsletter exchange. The collection also includes numerous videotapes, audiotapes, photographs, slides, computer media, posters, and artifacts.</p><p> This collection documents the professional career of Tracy Frisch in the decade before her founding of NYCAP. Material from her career as a New York State Legislature lobbyist and staff member is included, as well as materials from her research on environmental pests and pollution during the 1980s.</p><p> Strengths of the collection include the the collection of the publications from many local, state, and some national organizations, along with the collection of information on pesticides and pests from about 1980 to 2000, and the prominent subseries in the Issue Files Series, particularly Agriculture and Lawn, Health Issues from Pesticide / Chemical Use, and School / IPM. Other strengths include the conference material and the membership and mailing lists, which document the first fourteen years of NYCAP.</p>  </scopecontent>

workplace safety and health issues particularly, but not exclusively, its work on the Occupational Safety and Health Training and Education Program (OSHTEP). This was a New York State Department of Labor funded program that made up an important portion of NYCAP's budget. NYCAP held numerous training conferences in connection with this program, the main goals of which were to educate workers about proper pest control methods, the health issues and risks of pesticides used in the workplace, along with low-risk pest control alternatives, and workers rights / employers responsibilities.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_3a1817df697e39ec018a0ba6695728ec"

(IPM), a method of pest control that NYCAP advocated. IPM is defined as "the coordinated use of pest and environmental information with available pest control methods to prevent unacceptable levels of pest damage by the most economical means and with the least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment" [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/ipm.htm]. Most of the materials are centered around schools, particularly the Health Schools Network (HSN). Materials about pesticide / chemical use and related issues in schools, which are not primarily about IPM, are also included. This subseries has been divided into two additional subseries, one consisting of school-related materials, and the other IPM-related materials in other institutions.</p><p> A. Schools.</p><p> B.

Contents</head><p>This series consists of publications from different environmental and local groups that are in some way involved with NYCAP. Most of these publications are newsletter issues received as part of the newsletter exchange program. Most of the publications are in a limited run, covering only a few issues or years. The series has been divided up into NYCAP's publications, and those of other organizations. Aside from NYCAP's own publications, he most notable feature of this series is the substantial runs of a select few publications that NYCAP used heavily for reference and distribution. This includes <emph render="italic">Common Sense Pest Control Quarterly</emph>, <emph render="italic">IPM Practioner</emph>, <emph render="italic">Journal of Pesticide Reform</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Pesticides and You</emph>.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_b664d7f73d2528e71cea171bc8da0d66"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by subject.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_5371d61d83f15b6b96c91fde71f07993" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1: NYCAP Publications</unittitle><unitid>6.1</unitid><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1908/2002" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_073de9fa3b7da9ad25393592b89a742f" level="file"><did><unittitle>20th Century Living</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1995/1995" type="inclusive">1995</unitdate><container id="aspace_3cdc8279854a7ebc936d6f9d196f520a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1 (6-NYCAP Publications -

It consists primarily of photocopies of the work of others, on specific pesticides and pests. It has been divided up into two subseries, one for pesticides, and the other for pests. Two important sources of the pesticides information were the EPA Fact Sheets and the Extension Toxicology Network (EXTOXNET). The amount of material on each pesticide or pest ranges from a page or two to an entire linear foot on mosquitoes.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
