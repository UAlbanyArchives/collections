    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>James Joseph Delaney was born in New York City on March 19, 1901. He attended public schools in Long Island City, Queens and in 1931 received a law degree from St. John's University. Between 1936 and 1944, Delaney served as an assistant to the Queens District Attorney's office. Elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-ninth Congress in November 1944, Delaney was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1946 and resumed his law career thereafter. Delaney's hiatus from politics was short-lived following his election to the 81 st United States Congress in 1948. Having been reelected to 14 succeeding congresses Delaney served as Congressman from Queens, New York from January 3, 1949 until his retirement on December 31, 1978.</p><p> Delaney is noted for his campaign to have cancer-causing agents banned from food, drugs and cosmetics. Passed in 1958, the Delaney Amendment was a clause in the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that outlawed cancer-causing additives in food and commenced the federal government's role in protecting the public from cancer. His amendment required the Food and Drug Administration to monitor for any chemical additives in food that were found to induce cancer in man or animals. Delaney became involved with this issue as chairman of the Select House Committee that conducted an investigation and study of the use of chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides in and with respect to food products in January 1949 and again in January 1951. In 1996 Congress amended the Delaney Clause with the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) that changed the "zero risk" standard, which made no allowances, to one of "reasonable certainty."</p><p> Delaney was frequently at odds with fellow Democrats over his votes against federal aid to education, support for public aid to parochial schools, school busing, and his support of the Vietnam War. As chairman of the New York City Congressional delegation in the mid-1970's, he played a key role in shaping the federal legislation that helped rescue the city from its financial crisis by securing a 2.4 billion dollar low-interest loan. His three decades in Washington catapulted him into the chairmanship of the powerful Committee on Rules in January 1977.</p><p> Delaney married Lola Mathis in 1939 and had a son, Patrick. Following his retirement in 1978 James Joseph Delaney was a resident of Key Biscayne, Florida until his death at his son's home in Tenafly, New Jersey on May 24, 1987. Interment was in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York.</p>  </bioghist>
