<p>Founded in 1995, Healthy Schools Network is a national environmental health organization that does research, information, education, coalition-building, and advocacy to ensure that every child has a healthy learning environment that is clean and in good repair. According to its Website (2007), Healthy Schools Network has documented and publicized school environmental problems; shaped and won new education, health, and environmental policies; fostered dozens of local and state policy groups; won systemic federal and state reforms; and helped thousands of parents and schools make classrooms and buildings healthier through its EPA award-winning Healthy Schools/Healthy Kids Clearinghouse (Information and Referral Services).</p>  </bioghist>
