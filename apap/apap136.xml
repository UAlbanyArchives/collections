    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Dr. Alice P. Green (1940-2024) was known for her work as a criminal justice activist in New York State. Born in South Carolina, Alice Green grew up a member of one of the few Black families in the small Adirondack mining town of Witherbee, New York. Her early experiences as an outsider in a predominantly European American, Catholic community had a profound affect on the woman she would become.</p><p> Dr. Green earned a BA in Social Science Education followed by an MA in Secondary Education of Social Sciences and English from the University at Albany, SUNY in 1967. As a teacher, she found herself becoming increasingly interested in her students' home lives and problems, which led to her earning a Master of Social Work from the University at Albany, SUNY in 1973. In 1979, she received an MA in Criminal Justice and she earned her PhD from the School of Criminal Justice at the University at Albany in 1983.</p><p> Dr. Green founded the Center for Law and Justice in 1985 and served as executive director of the Center for many years. The Center for Law and Justice is a non-profit community organization that monitors criminal justice activities, provides legal assistance and criminal justice advocacy, organizes efforts to change social policy and empowers poor people and people of color. </p><p> Prior to the creation of The Center for Law and Justice, Dr. Green was Legislative Director for the New York Civil Liberties Union. Governor Mario Cuomo appointed her to the Citizens Policy and Complaint Review Council of the New York State Commission on Corrections in 1985. In 1986, Governor Cuomo appointed her to the position of Deputy Commissioner for the New York State Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives.</p><p> From 1975 through 1979, Dr. Green served as the Executive Director of Trinity Institution, a youth and family services center in Albany's South End neighborhood. During her time as director, she founded the South End Scene in 1977, one of the longest-running Black newspapers in Albany, New York.</p><p> In 1998, Dr. Green was running mate to Al "Grandpa" Lewis on the Green Party ticket for Lieutenant Governor of New York State. Her platform as a Green Party candidate was marked by her personal, progressive approach to criminal justice. This includes protesting the death penalty and life without parole prison sentences as well as encouraging law enforcement to make white-collar crime its number one priority. While unsuccessful in gaining the governorship, the Greens achieved their goal of receiving over 50,000 votes, which gave the party ballot status. Dr. Green was also a candidate for mayor of Albany in 2005. </p><p> Dr. Green was a published author of several books, articles and essays. These included her memoir "Outsider: Stories of Growing Up Black in the Adirondacks" (2023), "We Who Believe in Freedom: Activism and the Struggle for Social Justice," which explored police accountability, criminal justice and prison reform (2021) and "Law Never Here: A Social History of African American Responses to Issues of Crime and Justice" which she co-authored with Dr. Frankie Bailey.</p><p> Dr. Green was married to her husband, Charles Touhey, for 52 years and the couple lived in Albany during their marriage. She had two children and three grandchildren. She was honored with numerous awards for her efforts to bring change to the criminal justice system and to people of color in New York State. These included the Citizen Laureate Award from the University at Albany; distinguished Alumna Award from Rockefeller College, University at Albany; Service Award from the Albany Chapter of the NAACP; Woman of the Year Award from the YWCA; the Founder's Award and Community Service Award from the Scene Newspaper; the Community Service Award from the Albany Social Justice Center; Tile Service Award from the Israel AME Church in Albany; Shaker and Mover Award from the National Organization for Women; Black Solidarity Award from Prisoners of Auburn; Distinguished Service Award from the Prisoners of Green Haven; New York State Bar Association Public Service Medal; Victor A. Lord Courage of Convictions Award; Certificate of Recognition from the Lifers' Committee, Shawangunk Correctional Facility; and the Community Service Award from the Walls Temple AME Zion Church.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is particularly strong in following Alice Green's appearances in the media in the 1980s and 1990s. The media references not only follow Dr. Green's professional career, but also highlight her activities as a fervent protestor and activist for the rights of prisoners, in attempts to repeal the Rockefeller Drug Laws and as a member of a police watchdog group in Albany. Her speeches and writings further serve to support her stance on these and other issues of the time. All news clippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper for preservation purposes.</p><p> The collection follows the progress of the book <title render="italic">Law Never Here: A Social History of African American Responses to Issues of Crime and Justice</title>, which Dr. Green co-wrote with Dr. Frankie Bailey, from the initial proposals and outlines through its reviews and appearances in catalogs.</p><p> The collection also contains information on Dr. Green's bid for Lieutenant Governor on the Green Party ticket in New York State in 1998. While Alice Green's role in the 1998 election is the central focus of this series, it also provides information on the Green Party, their opponents in the election, and information about Dr. Green's running mate, Al "Grandpa" Lewis, who is best known for his role as Grandpa Munster on the 1960s television series, <emph render="italic">The Munsters</emph>. The only non-paper items in the collection are found in the Campaign Materials series, in the form of campaign buttons and a key chain.</p><p> While the correspondence series is not particularly large, it is here that letters of interest are found from Secretary of State, New York Senator, and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, former mayor of Albany, New York, Thomas Whalen III, and comedian Richard Pryor.</p><p> There is a small amount of information present concerning her personal and family life, particularly relating to her husband, Charles Touhey, her son, John Green, and her hobby as an amateur runner. Among these items is Johnnie Cochran's autograph on a menu from a dinner of the One Hundred Black Men of Albany, New York.</p><p> The collection is lacking in information about Dr. Green's early career. There is very little about her education, her early days in the Albany chapter of the NAACP and her time as executive director of the Trinity Institution. The correspondence series is rather sparse, as well.</p><p> The M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives also holds the manuscript collection of the Center for Law and Justice (APAP-072), founded by Dr. Green in 1985. This collection provides valuable information about Dr. Green's work with the center. The Department's holdings also include issues of the <title render="italic">South End Scene</title> or <title render="italic">Scene</title> from July 1978 through July 1985 on microfilm. The microfilm is available for use in the Department. A manuscript collection for the NAACP, Albany Branch (APAP-074) is also available at the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives.</p>  </scopecontent>

Loose clippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper for preservation, while shorter newsletters have been kept in their entirety. The collection begins sparsely in the mid-1960s and becomes increasingly dense as Dr. Green furthers her career and becomes better known in the Capital District. While the collection covers a wide variety of newspaper mentions about Dr. Green and her actions, highlights include her role as chair of the NAACP's Legal Redress Committee, during which she became involved in high-profile murder and race relations cases in 1984 and 1985; her part as a founder and member of a police watchdog group in Albany from 1986 through 1990; and her much-publicized protests at the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day events hosted by Governor Pataki from 1995 through 1999. As a high-profile criminologist in Albany, Dr. Green is often consulted on justice and civil liberties issues as they touch the Capital District. Some of the news clippings do not mention Dr. Green directly but are related to issues and activities she was directly involved in. The series also contains certificates and awards granted to Dr. Green and the programs and announcements that accompanied these honors. The oversized box contains a folder of materials from this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_b2c7915226a9914a7517c92214d6f977" level="file"><did><unittitle>News Clippings</unittitle><unitdate

The speeches are unpublished and many of the notes and outlines are handwritten, and therefore, it is difficult to determine the date or event at which they may have been delivered. The series includes one audio cassette of the address Dr. Green delivered at the Albany Academy's 1985 commencement. Alice Green's son, John A. Green, was a graduate of this class. A folder in the oversized box contains posters for events at which Dr. Green spoke.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_9e6807aa4353db79e52422e1994fc8a1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Speeches and

A folder in the oversized box contains correspondence with attached legal-sized documents and cards made out of construction paper.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_3afde8c85391590531d7c38fc7c64e60" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1960/1960" type="inclusive">1960</unitdate><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1977/1977" type="inclusive">1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_c908eb4a75276104adbd168d1de2eaaa" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_b2b4930142b8aaa1f80cbc5fc72c0884" parent="aspace_c908eb4a75276104adbd168d1de2eaaa" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6c6bf0cbd99d3e73d17f8c86956adc10" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1980/1985" type="inclusive">1980-1985</unitdate><container id="aspace_8451ffe89860cc837b74a38434ec463f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_e42f89c5fa12a4a0234e5959e3e0a891" parent="aspace_8451ffe89860cc837b74a38434ec463f" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_432f1e22ad4ff41f1668599abaa225aa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1986/1989" type="inclusive">1986-1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_8b81bd6675e1cce17dbfddef99ff55b4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_24ef8b5ef31cc0ab19517a67f73a4f42" parent="aspace_8b81bd6675e1cce17dbfddef99ff55b4" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d66e3e7a1454bf0df00e16149155dcda" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1990/1997" type="inclusive">1990-1997</unitdate><container id="aspace_57ad6fb12b26d2c44b1bf1fd7894a4b7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_f2d1a27230017404fb90ef8a0cd906f8" parent="aspace_57ad6fb12b26d2c44b1bf1fd7894a4b7" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6e455505eca18a9061a7b036364354e4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1998/1998" type="inclusive">1998</unitdate><container id="aspace_3c5e7db815185bff38a15b1d5ca9f531" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_ef56f4f2caca16bbe9dc79b8e7f67ddb" parent="aspace_3c5e7db815185bff38a15b1d5ca9f531" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_3084ee7be004c1814289c1a8eeae6ed2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1999/1999" type="inclusive">1999</unitdate><container id="aspace_cb87657f3c4e1171a53ea4ccb83a82b8" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_43cc0ee4acabb538340d345c50117c9e" parent="aspace_cb87657f3c4e1171a53ea4ccb83a82b8" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_aa45ac579f6e254449354b36a2c38054" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="2000/2001" type="inclusive">2000-2001</unitdate><container id="aspace_e73ac0b4211298edd3d613558ba5c35f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_a9dbd47d754ec1e1e028d6db577a8891" parent="aspace_e73ac0b4211298edd3d613558ba5c35f" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_50938bc1708225d043c5722a6c6c8aab" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1960/2001" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_77f284a0ab30aee84fcd2ea4cc438749" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">5 (4-Correspondence)</container><container id="aspace_3fa2a0f1e64c829592c447baffa08f5d" parent="aspace_77f284a0ab30aee84fcd2ea4cc438749" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_07900611557cf0cd389b2b0e5c3b104c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letter from Former Mayor of Albany Thomas M.
