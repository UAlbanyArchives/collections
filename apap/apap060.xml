Daniel Mahoney, 1962-86; and Serphin Maltese, 1986-88. The strength of the records is in its documentation of New York State politics and elections (including the State Legislature and other state offices), the Conservative Party's political endorsements and candidates (including writer William F. Buckley, Jr., and Sen. James Buckley), and the political goals and ideological positions on contemporary issues.</abstract>

    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Conservative Party of New York State, also commonly referred to as the New York State Conservative Party, was officially founded in 1962. Efforts to form the party were initiated following the Republican loss of New York State in the 1960 Presidential Election. In 1961 disaffected Republicans, led by New York City attorneys Kiernan O'Doherty and J. Daniel Mahoney, formed the organizing committee for the New York State Conservative Political Association, Inc., a membership corporation. This association was established as a base upon which to build the Conservative Party, "a fourth party, to counter the influence of the New York Liberal Party" [Mahoney, J. Daniel, <emph render="italic">Actions Speak Louder</emph> (New York: Arlington House), p. 24]. The Conservative Party's intent was to "exercise leverage upon the major political parties by endorsing and working for candidates from either party whose views paralleled its own, and running its own candidates where acceptable major party candidates were not put forth" [Mahoney, J. Daniel, <emph render="italic">Actions Speak Louder</emph> (New York: Arlington House), p. 23]</p><p> State headquarters opened in April 1962 as the Conservative Party, Inc. which performed the operations of the party through 1962. Due to provisions of the New York State Election Law, the party did not become an official political party until election day of that year. Red-tape was bypassed by taking over and renaming the defunct Freedom Party, Inc. Development of the party began with the creation of local party clubs which were viewed as the party's "main political resource" [Mahoney, J. Daniel, <emph render="italic">Actions Speak Louder</emph> (New York: Arlington House), p. 125]. Interim county committees were formed, and by 1963 there was a county chairman for each of New York State's 62 counties. It was not until 1964 that county committees were elected consisting of two to four members from each election district.</p><p> The party's Organizing Committee was redesignated in 1962 as the State Committee and a State Executive Committee was created. The State Committee, like the county committees, was not duly elected until 1964. It consisted of three members from each Congressional district meeting one to two times annually. The State Committee acts as a general oversight body for the party. The State Executive Committee, which meets on a regular basis, controls the implementation of policy. Party officers include the State Chairman, State Vice Chairmen, Secretary and Treasurer. In 1971 the position of Executive Director was instituted to handle many of the administrative details that could no longer be performed by the State Chairman alone.</p><p> Chairmen</p><p> Kiernan O'Doherty--1962</p><p> J.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the Conservative Party of New York State (hereafter referred to as CPNYS) include party news releases, bulletins, some State Committee and State Executive Committee meeting minutes, election material (such as authorizations and designating petitions of party candidates), party legislative programs, publications, and news clippings. Information on CPNYS candidates is scattered between the Subject Files, which consist primarily of reference material, and the official election campaign documents of the Chairman's Subject Files. The most complete campaign information is that for James L. Buckley's U.S. Senatorial Campaign of 1970. Records related to that campaign are located in the Subject Files and Buckley Files.</p><p> The strength of this collection is in the documentation of the CPNYS's positions on social, political and economic issues. The most substantive information is in the News Releases File. Unfortunately that series contains no records for 1967, 1982, 1984 and 1985. News releases for these missing years may be found in the Subject File. The Position Papers also provide valuable information about the party's ideological stance on a limited range of topics (twenty-six). The Legislative Programs in the Chairman's Subject Files provide extensive information on the political goals of the party and are complete except for a major gap from 1979 to 1985. Among the printed materials in the Chairman's Subject Files are reprinted articles and mass mailings. These documents provide an indication of the party's position on a variety of issues.</p><p> Although the records span the period from 1962 to 1988 the bulk of the records covers the 1970s and are primarily reference in nature.</p><p> An additional 6 cubic feet of records were deposited in August 2004, August 2006, October 2006, and November 2006, but are not yet described in this finding aid.</p>  </scopecontent>
