    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Council 82 was formed through the merger of two unions, Councils 30 and 50. Council 30, when it began, solicited the membership of all state employees. The corrections officers decided Council 30 had neglected its duty to bargain in good faith for them and opted to establish their own union to, address more fully the rigors of their profession. In 1953, members of the Correction Officers Association (COA) negotiated with the corrections employees of Council 30 to organize their own separate union. The 662 COA members from eight prisons formed what would become Council 50. On September 3, 1969 correctional employees from Council 50 and Council 30 consolidated their efforts and formed Council 82. The union's first contract with New York State was signed In 1970.</p><p> Council 82, like other unions, lobbied the state to Increase wages and benefits but more Importantly to increase support staff throughout the state's overcrowded correctional facilities. In September 1971 a riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York left 11 corrections officers and 32 inmates dead. Council 82 used the incident at Attica to petition the state for more satisfactory working conditions and an increase in staff. </p><p> In April 1979, 6,400 corrections employees went on strike for 16 days. Council 82 was fined $2.5 million for contempt of court under New York's Taylor Law. The fine was later reduced to $150,000 which the court allowed to be paid in monthly installments so as to permit the union to continue operations. Council 82 also lost its privilege of dues check-off for three months as a result of the strike. </p><p> Council 82 experienced two other major hostage crises. The first was the Ossining takeover. In January 1983, 600 inmates in Cell Block B took 19 corrections officers hostage for 53 hours. Council 82 experienced its last major hostage crisis on August 1, 1988. Five corrections officers were taken hostage at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility. The officers were released, unharmed, the next day. </p><p> In 1984 The Union of Federated Corrections Officers (TUFCO) challenged Council 82 as the exclusive representative of the state's Security and Law Enforcement Employees. An election was held so that members could vote for the representative of their choice. On February 22, 1985 the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) announced Council 82's victory over the T.U.F.C.O. association. </p><p> Council 82 Is the exclusive bargaining representative of over 22,000 Security and Law Enforcement employees. With the exception of the State Police, Council 82 represents all New York State law enforcement personnel.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of Council 82 document every year of the organization's existence with minutes, newspapers, and other material. Council 82's records are divided into six series: Executive Board Files, 1969,1972-86; Subject Files, 1968-87; Legal Files, 1976-84; T.U.F.C.O. Files, 1983-87; Sing Sing Local 1413, Records, 1972-80; and Council 82 Newspapers, 1971, 1974, 1980-89. </p><p> Council 82 was one of the first and became one of the largest and most important of the public sector unions to organize after the implementation of the Taylor Law. The records of Council 82 document how a large union organized itself at the state level and initiated a dialogue with the state of New York. One of the most important activities of Council 82 has been to negotiate contracts with the state, and minutes, newspapers, and subject files, each in different ways, elucidate the procedures and accomplishments of these negotiations. </p><p> The most extensive series is the Executive Board files, which contain correspondence and minutes of Executive Board meetings and which give a good idea of the activities of the union during almost its entire history. This series documents the entire range of Council 82's activities: political action, lobbying, and relations with the state and other unions. The other series give more detailed information on some activities of Council 82. The newspapers, for example, are the public voice of Council 82 and the clearest indication of the union's opinion about corrections policy and other matters. </p><p> The records of Sing Sing Local 1413 are records that were transferred to Council 82 when Local 1413 closed down. These are the only records that were not produced by the statewide union itself.</p>  </scopecontent>

minutes of the Correction Policy Committee (1968-78), and minutes of meetings of local presidents' (1981, 1983-85). The subject files are a record of the activities of Council 82, the bulk of the series consisting of annual convention minutes, Correction Policy Committee correspondence and minutes, and correspondence with the Department of Correctional Services. Conspicuously absent from the files is documentation on the 1971 riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York. Similarly, there is little documentation pertaining to the strike of 1979 during which 6,400 corrections employees went on strike for 16 days.</p></scopecontent><c
