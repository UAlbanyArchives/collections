One of nearly 60 local leagues in New York State, the League of Women Voters of Saratoga County (formerly the League of Women Voters, Saratoga Springs Area) formed in early 1965. This collection documents the operation and activities of this local league from its founding through 2010.</abstract>

    <head>Organizational Sketch</head>
<p>The (National) League of Women Voters (LWV) was founded by Carrie Chapman Catt in 1920 during the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The convention was held just six months before the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, giving women the right to vote after a 72-year struggle.</p><p> The League began as a "mighty political experiment" designed to help 20 million women carry out their new responsibilities as voters. It encouraged them to use their new power to participate in shaping public policy. From the beginning, the League has been an activist, grassroots organization whose leaders believed that citizens should play a critical role in advocacy. The League is proud to be nonpartisan, neither supporting nor opposing candidates or political parties at any level of government, but always working on vital issues of concern to members and the public.</p><p> The League, now open to men and women, has 150,000 plus members, and supporters in the U.S., with Leagues in every state, Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., the Virgin Islands and Hong Kong. Statewide in New York, there are nearly 60 local leagues with approximately 8000 members.</p><p> The Saratoga County Chapter was founded in 1965, as a "provisional league," under the name of League of Women Voters of the Saratoga Springs Area. At the time, with the exception of Saratoga Springs, most of Saratoga County consisted of small towns and farming areas, with some residents of the southern portion of the county having closer ties to the Schenectady County Chapter of the league. Thus it was decided to make Saratoga Springs the hub of this new chapter, specifically including the towns of Saratoga Springs, Wilton and Greenfield. To fulfill national requirements, a thorough study of the community was prepared early in 1965, and members were recruited to meet the 25 member minimum. The chapter was granted authority from the national organization in early 1965, and had its first organizational meeting on April 8, 1965. A membership total of 59 was reported at the April 28, 1965 board meeting. In April, 1967 the organization was granted "full league" status.</p><p> In 1999, with the demise of the Southern Saratoga County LWV (previously know as the Shenendehowa LWV), it was decided to apply for expansion to include the whole county in the organization. Permission was granted by the national LWV on February 17, 2000 for the name change to League of Women Voters of Saratoga County (LWVSC). Members of disbanded chapters were invited to join. (Records of the LWV of Southern Saratoga County are not included in the collection.)</p><p> Since 2000, the LWVSC has expanded its activities and membership to serve the whole county. The 2010-2011 membership list includes approximately 160 members.</p><p> The stated mission of the LWVSC, like its parent organization, is as follows: The League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan political organization, encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.</p><p> The information provided above was gleaned from the following sources:</p>    <list type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains the records of the League of Women Voters of Saratoga County (LWVSC), from its founding in 1965 through 2010. It documents the organization's internal functioning and its public activities during that time. Included are the administrative documents of the chapter: by-laws and revisions, membership and officer lists, annual reports, annual meeting program information, some correspondence, budget and financial statements, monthly meeting minutes, and monthly member bulletins (newsletters). Information on the work of the chapter in education, outreach and advocacy projects is detailed by project, and includes meeting notes, studies, reports, surveys, photographs and news clippings. In addition to the newsletters, there are various other publications the league sponsored. Also included are a small number of videotapes, mainly of local "Meet the Candidate" events.</p><p> While records of the disbanded LWV of Southern Saratoga County are not included in the collection, the Project and Subject Files contain a few projects in which this group participated, and a Clifton Park-Halfmoon Community Study from 1971, apparently prepared for purposes of securing provisional league status for that organization.</p><p> The archivist retained file titles created by the League of Women Voters of Saratoga County.</p><p> Researchers also may wish to consult the League of Women Voters of Albany County Records (APAP-128), the League of Women Voters of Rensselaer County Records (APAP-103) and the League of Women Voters of Schenectady County Records (APAP-210) held by the Department of Special Collections and Archives.</p>  </scopecontent>
