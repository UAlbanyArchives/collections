    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Hudson Valley Area Joint Board was formed in 1957 through the merger of the Columbia County and Mid-Hudson Valley Joint Boards. At this point, the two joint boards were affiliated of the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA), which merged with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in 1976 to form the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU).  
The Columbia County Joint Board, which had existed at least since 1947 and was made up of Locals 96, 791, 792, 793, 938, 1122, 1246, and 1342, merged with the Mid-Hudson Joint Board, chartered 1948 and made up of Locals 464, 501, 673, 683, 893, 982, 988, 1001, 1032, 1088, 1121, 1122, 1277, 1818, 1338, and 1420, in 1957 to form the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board.  The Capital District Joint Board chartered in 1937 (the year the TWUA began, as the Textile Workers Organizing Committee or TWOC) and made up of Locals 89, 237, 238, 346, 574, 575, 675, 907, 964, 976 and 1351, joined with the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board as well in 1968.  The Amsterdam Joint Board, chartered 1942 and made up of Locals 1, 489, 646, 835, 846 and 1761, merged with the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board during this period as well.</p>  </bioghist>
