<p>
The Hudson Valley Area Joint Board was formed in 1957 through the merger of the Columbia County and Mid-Hudson Valley Joint Boards. At this point, the two joint boards were affiliated of the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA), which merged with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in 1976 to form the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU). After the formation of the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board in 1957, other joint boards joined the union. The Capital District Joint Board, which was chartered in 1937, joined the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board in 1968. The Amsterdam Joint Board, which was charted in 1942, also joined the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board in the mid 1960's.  All of the joint boards had local chapters that represented different workplaces and institutions. Each local chapter had its own set of bylaws and constitutions, and each institution had its own set of bylaws and constitutions as well.</p><p>Prior to the merge the Capital District Joint Board oversaw the Berkshire Joint Board, which was chartered in 1946.  When the merge occurred, the Hudson Valley Area Joint Board oversaw their records until 1968-1969. The Berkshire Joint Board then joined the Connecticut Joint Board in 1969. The Capital District Area Joint Board was also affiliated with the Troy Area Industrial Union Council, CIO. The Hudson Valley Area Joint Board was also associated with the AFL-CIO and helped keep track of their local unions. These unions included the Upper Hudson Area Industrial Council, which became the Upper Hudson Area Central Labor Union in 1958. These records were held by the Columbia County Joint Board until the merge. The Hudson Valley Area Joint Board also helped maintain the Central Labor Union of New York records as well.</p>  </bioghist>
