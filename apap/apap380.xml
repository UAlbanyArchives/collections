    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Capital District Regional Planning Commission (CDRPC) is a regional planning and resource center, established pursuant to New York State law, serving Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties.  CDRPC was created in 1967 by a cooperative agreement amongst these four counties. Its original purpose was to perform and support comprehensive planning work, including surveys, planning services, technical services, and the formulation of plans and policies to promote coordinated development of the entire Capital Region. Over time, the mission of the CDRPC evolved in response to changes in the needs of the Capital Region, funding sources, organizational structures, and information technology. While continuing to provide a wide variety of comprehensive planning services, CDRPC has also assumed the functions of Data and Information Center, Economic Development District, Foreign-Trade Zone Administrator, Climate Smart Communities Coordinator, and Water Quality Manager.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was arranged and described in 2019-2020 by Jesse McCaughey.</p>  </processinfo>
  <arrangement id="aspace_ee697176effbd9677b6c2727566f23e7">
    <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
<p>The collection is arranged into six series: Albany County, Rensselaer County, Saratoga County, Schenectady County, Capital District, and Greater Region.  Planning documents that describe work sited in only one of the four home counties of the Capital District are filed in the series named for that county, labeled with the most relevant village, town, or city. For documents that include plans that span county boundaries within the Capital District -- e.g., the Port of Albany or the I-87 Northway -- those have been filed in the series entitled "Capital District." All other documents in the series, whose plans pertain to areas entirely outside the four home counties of the Capital District, are filed in the series entitled "Greater Region." Examples of the last category include plans for the Adirondack Park, the Lower Hudson River, and western New York.
 
Some common file types within the collection include comprehensive/master plans, local waterfront revitalization plans, environmental impact assessments, soil surveys, and water/sewer plans. A special indication is present for those documents that contain either a supplemental or a fold-out map.
 
Particular sites for which there are a substantial number of documents include the Albany Pine Bush Preserve, the Port of Albany, Albany Airport, and Adirondack Park. The earliest dated documents in the collection are USGS soil surveys from the 1930s. However, the great majority of documents date from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p>  </arrangement>
