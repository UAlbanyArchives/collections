    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Capital District Regional Planning Commission (CDRPC) is a regional planning and resource center, established pursuant to New York State law, serving Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties.  CDRPC was created in 1967 by a cooperative agreement amongst these four counties. Its original purpose was to perform and support comprehensive planning work, including surveys, planning services, technical services, and the formulation of plans and policies to promote coordinated development of the entire Capital Region. Over time, the mission of the CDRPC evolved in response to changes in the needs of the Capital Region, funding sources, organizational structures, and information technology. While continuing to provide a wide variety of comprehensive planning services, CDRPC has also assumed the functions of Data and Information Center, Economic Development District, Foreign-Trade Zone Administrator, Climate Smart Communities Coordinator, and Water Quality Manager.</p>  </bioghist>
