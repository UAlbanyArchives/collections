    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>First organized in 1960 as the New York State Association of Museums (NYSAM) and chartered by the New York State Education Department in 1962, as it exists today, the Museum Association of New York (MANY) is the product of a 2013-2014 merger with the Upstate History Alliance (UHA). The UHA began its life as a member of the Field Service Alliance (FSA), a nationwide organization, and operated under the name of the Regional Council of Historical Societies (RCHS) for much of its corporate life. Prior to the merger, UHA changed its name to MuseumWise. That name was discarded as part of the merger process.</p>

<p>Today, the Museum Association of New York is the only statewide museum service organization with more than 700 member museums, historical societies, zoos, botanical gardens, and aquariums. MANY works with museums and museum professionals to develop and share best practices through advocacy, training, and networking opportunities.</p>  </bioghist>
