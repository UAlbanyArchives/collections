    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>During World War ll many citizens in the United States monitored shortwave radio transmissions for information and news updates.  It was often possible to hear updates about prisoners of war during these broadcasts.  Irwin (born June 7, 1899-death unknown) and Violet Bender (born February 27, 1906-death unknown) of Oberlin and Harrisburg Pa. were active in shortwave radio monitoring during this time. Irwin worked as a milkman at the Philadelphia Dairy and Violet was a homemaker.  After receiving a message about a prisoner of war, the Benders attempted to contact the respective prisoner’s family and give them updates about where the prisoner was being held.  The FBI investigated Irwin because of his shortwave monitoring and asked him to cease and desist which he did, but Violet kept monitoring.   </p><p>It was through these radio transmissions that Irwin and Violet were introduced to a woman named Mildred Gillars (November 29, 1900-June 25, 1988), known as Axis Sally.  Axis Sally was a radio broadcaster and propagandist for Germany during World War ll.  After the war she was returned to the United States, convicted of treason on March 10, 1949, served 12 years in prison, and then released on June 10, 1961. Violet and Irwin maintained that Axis Sally was innocent of her charges and worked tirelessly on behalf of her defense, writing letters to lawyers, politicians, and past POWs and their families in hopes of freeing her.  During this time, Irwin and Violet corresponded frequently with Axis Sally’s sister, Edna Gillars Herrick which began a friendship that lasted throughout Axis Sally’s incarceration.</p>  </bioghist>
