    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Paul B. Hanks Jr. was born on March 4, 1923. He graduated from the University of Rochester with a BA degree. Hanks also graduated from Cornell Law with an LLB. He was also a World War II veteran and served as a radar navigator in the Pacific Theatre. Hanks was a member of the New York State Bar, Harsch-Crisp Seaman Post, No. 379, American Legion, V.F.W., Brockport Volunteer Fire Department, Phi Delta Phi Legal Fraternity and many other organizations. </p><p>Constituents from Monroe County's 3rd District elected Hanks to the New York State Assembly in 1952.  A Republican, he served in the Assembly until 1964.  Hanks served as chair of the Military Affairs Committee and was a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Banks Committee, Canals and Waterways, and Villages Committee.  Hanks was also the vice-chair of the Joint Legislative Committee on Unsatisfied Judgment Fund and Compulsory Automobile Insurance and a member of the Joint Legislative Committee on Winter Tourists and Interstate Cooperation.</p><p>The Hanks files document his passion for education. There are extensive materials about education budget, further education, adult education, and state university budget. Hanks wanted to give everyone a chance to learn at an affordable price. Not only did he want education to be accessible for adults, but he also wanted the school budgets to be used wisely. </p><p>Hanks also was passionate about the alcohol beverage control laws (A.B.C. Laws), and seat belt laws. Hanks compiled countless reports on the effects that alcohol had on young people and how it led to more motor vehicle accidents. Hanks wanted to cut down this effect by changing the A.B.C. laws and by raising the drinking age to 21. Hanks' papers also discuss the elevated damage that not wearing a seatbelt could result with vehicle accidents. Hanks was quite forward-looking with these ideas. The drinking age was not raised to 21 in New York until 1985. The first mandatory seat belt law went into effect in 1984 in New York.</p><p>Hanks passed away on September 17, 2002. He was survived by his two sons, daughter, six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.</p>  </bioghist>
