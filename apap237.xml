      <p>Henry Curran initially donated his papers to Syracuse University in the late 1960s. In

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Henry Curran was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania in 1918 and graduated from Pace College.
        He served as an officer on the European front during World War II and during the Korean War.
        He married Rita Rothmann and together they had three sons and one daughter in Oyster Bay,
        Long Island.</p>
      <p> A Republican, Curran began his political career as a deputy sheriff and was elected town
        clerk of Oyster Bay in 1953. Seven years later voters elected him to the New York State
        Senate representing the Third District, which covers part of Nassau County. During his
        tenure in the State Senate, he was chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee to Revise
        Banking Law and a member of the Joint Legislative Committee on Election Law, the committee
        on Matrimonial and Family Laws, the committee on Penal Institutions, as well as a member of
        the Education, Finance, Mental Hygiene, Roads and Public Works, Taxation, and Towns and
        Counties committees. Curran left the State Senate and Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed
        him chair the New York State Harness Racing Commission in 1969. He held that post until
        1975. </p>
      <p>In addition to his public service, Curran was a partner in Curran, Cooney, Penny Agency,
        Inc., a general insurance firm in Garden City, Long Island. He also was a trustee of the
        Emigrant Savings Bank.</p>
      <p>Curran died in North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, NY on March 13th, 1993. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Henry Curran Papers consist of a mixture of sponsored legislation files and news
        clippings from Curran's tenure in the New York State Senate (1961-1968). The former contains
        draft or final copies of the bill, fact sheets, and memos. The clips are predominantly about
        Curran, his career or banking law. The Curran Papers also include two reports from the Joint
        Legislative Committee to Revise Banking Law from 1967 and 1968 as well as supplementary
        material related to that committee's work.</p>
