      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p> William Kennedy, born 1928 in Albany, New York, is an award-winning
          <occupation>author</occupation> and <occupation>journalist</occupation>. He is best known
        for his “Albany Cycle” of eight published novels, one of which, <title><emph render="italic"> Ironweed</emph></title>, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1984.</p>
      <p>Following his childhood and primary and secondary schooling in Albany, Kennedy attended
        nearby Siena College where he earned a bachelor of arts degree and edited the school's
        newspaper. Kennedy then began his professional literary career as a journalist at a local
        newspaper, followed by a U.S. Army newspaper during military service in Europe, the Albany
            <title><emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph></title>, and later as the managing
        editor of the <title><emph render="italic">San Juan Star</emph></title> in 1959. After
        attending Saul Bellow's fiction writing workshop at the University of Puerto Rico, he left
        his editorial position to focus on a career as a writer and subsequently returned to Albany
        in 1963. Kennedy initially wrote feature articles part-time for the Albany <title><emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph></title> about slum conditions and integration in the
        city that garnered him a Pulitzer Prize nomination and were later the inspiration for his
        nonfiction work <title><emph render="italic">O Albany!</emph></title> (1983). While serving
        as the <title><emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph></title> film critic, he released his
        first novel <title><emph render="italic">The Ink Truck</emph></title> (1969).</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1975 with his novel <title><emph render="italic">Legs</emph></title>, Kennedy
        introduced his “Albany Cycle” of fiction, books that center upon the state capital and
        frequently focus on the struggles of recurrent characters, most notably the extended Phelan
        family. To date he published seven additional novels in this series, most recently
            <title><emph render="italic">Chango’s Beads and Two-Tone Shoes</emph></title> (2011).
        Kennedy also co-authored two children’s books with his son <persname>Brendan
          Kennedy</persname>, <title><emph render="italic">Charlie Malarkey and the Belly Button
            Machine</emph></title> (1986), and <title><emph render="italic">Charlie Malarkey and the
            Singing Moose</emph></title> (1993). His first play, <title><emph render="italic">Grand
            View</emph></title> (1996) appeared at the Capital Repertory Theatre in Albany. Kennedy
        released a second nonfiction book, <title><emph render="italic">Riding the Yellow Trolley
            Car</emph></title>, in 1993, a collection of essays, interviews, and human interest
        stories from the past 40 years.</p>
      <p>Kennedy also garnered attention with his screenplay writing. He co-wrote <title><emph render="italic">The Cotton Club</emph></title> (1984) with the movie’s director
          <persname>Francis Ford Coppola</persname>. He penned the script for the film version of
        his novel <title><emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph></title> (1987).</p>
      <p>In addition to his own writing career, Kennedy serves as a cultural and educational mentor
        to others in the field. Kennedy is the founder and executive director of the University at
        Albany-based New York State Writers Institute. He joined the University at Albany’s English
        Department in 1974, teaching creative writing and journalism as an instructor until 1982,
        and now serves as a professor. He also taught at Cornell University in 1982-1983 and was
        professor at the University of Oregon from 2001-2002.</p>
      <p>Today Kennedy is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the
        Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and serves on the board of directors of the New
        York State Council for the Humanities. In addition to his Pulitzer Prize, he also received
        many other awards and accolades including a National Book Critics Circle Award, a MacArthur
        Fellowship (Genius Award), part of which served to establish the Writers Institute, a
        National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and a Regents Medal of Excellence from the State
        University of New York.</p>
      <p>Kennedy met and married his wife Dana Sosa while working in Puerto Rico, and the couple has
        three adult children.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p> The William Kennedy Papers document nearly a half century of research, writing, and
        publishing efforts of the internationally recognized, Pulitzer Prize winning author,
        playwright, essayist, journalist, script writer, professor, and champion of the arts. Born
        and raised in Albany, New York, Kennedy’s novels and nonfiction works frequently evoke a
        strong sense of place in the state capital, centering upon the city, its history, and its
        people during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>
      <p>Kennedy transferred his materials to the M. E. Grenander Department of Special Collections
        and Archives at the University at Albany through a series of acquisitions beginning in 2002.
        The collection features records related to all of Kennedy’s fiction and nonfiction books
        through 2002 as well as essays and newspaper articles from the Albany <title><emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph></title>. Well-known for embodying the heart of Albany
        in his work, Kennedy’s donations include extensive material from his “Albany Cycle” of
        novels, most prominently the Pulitzer Prize winning <title><emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph></title> (1984). However, his earlier works like <title><emph render="italic">Legs</emph></title> (1975) and more recent endeavors, such as
            <title><emph render="italic">The Flaming Corsage</emph></title> (1996) and <title><emph render="italic">Roscoe</emph></title> (2002) are also well represented. Kennedy also
        wrote two children’s books with his son, with related papers in the collection. All the
        files chronicle Kennedy’s meticulous research, writing, publishing, and promotion processes
        and feature proposals, numerous drafts with edits, rewrites, galleys, page proofs,
        correspondence, reviews, interviews, residual checks, and printed ephemera.</p>
      <p>The Kennedy Papers also chart the transition of novels to film; Kennedy’s own <title><emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph></title>, filmed in the Albany area, which appeared on
        the big screen in 1987, and James Haskins’ <title><emph render="italic">The Cotton
            Club</emph></title> from 1984 for which Kennedy co-wrote the screen play with director
        Francis Ford Coppola. Relevant papers include working drafts, shooting scripts, looping and
        line scripts, production notes, call sheets, shooting schedules, and cast lists. In addition
        the collection has materials related to movie premieres, public relations efforts to market
        the films, and critics’ reviews.</p>
      <p>Kennedy’s correspondence files demonstrate his significant role in late twentieth and early
        twenty-first century American literature and the arts and offer insights into relationships
        with other key figures in American literature. Letters detail his close friendships and
        associations with fellow authors, most notably mentor Saul Bellow and Hunter S. Thompson, as
        well as John Cheever, Frank McCourt, Joyce Carol Oates, and Philip Roth. The collection also
        features exchanges with journalists, poets and New York politicians, including <persname>Gay
          Talese</persname>, <persname>Andy Rooney</persname>, and former governor <persname>Mario
          Cuomo</persname>.</p>
      <p>In addition to having a dedicated series for each of Kennedy's fiction and nonfiction books
        through 2002, both film scripts, children's books, and correspondence, the papers feature
        series devoted to related work and other endeavors. The collection holds Kennedy's
        professional and personal research, interviews, essays, and newspaper articles. In 1995
        Kennedy accompanied President Clinton on a trip to Ireland and Northern Ireland as Clinton
        engaged in key peacemaking efforts. The collection includes background information briefings
        for the visit, correspondence, and news clips. </p>

          <p> Contains materials about Kennedy's first novel <emph render="italic">The Ink
              Truck</emph>, initially published in 1969 and then re-issued in 1984 following his
            success with <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph> and his receiving the MacArthur
            Foundation's Genius Award. The novel details the last days of an unsuccessful newspaper
            strike and is very loosely based on Kennedy's experiences during a newspaper strike in
            Albany in the mid-1960s. The series includes multiple manuscript drafts, author's notes,
            book reviews, galleys, publisher agreements and correspondence, and advertising. Please
            note that the overall series dates are not inclusive. </p>

          <p> This series consists of multiple manuscript drafts, notes, and galleys for Kennedy's
            third novel <emph render="italic">Billy Phelan's Greatest Game</emph>, published in
            1978. The story introduces the Phelan family that figures prominently in five additional
            Kennedy books. Set in Albany during the Depression, Billy Phelan is a small-time gambler
            and bookie who becomes involved in the kidnapping of a local political boss' son. More
            than half of the folders in the series contain Federal Bureau of Investigation records
            of the actual John J. O'Connell, Jr. kidnapping and subsequent extortion case in 1933.
            The O'Connell family was heavily involved in Democratic Party politics in Albany.
            Kennedy also corresponded with the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the O'Connell
            kidnapping and received additional case records after the publication of <emph render="italic">Billy Phelan's Greatest Game</emph>. </p>

          <p> This series consists almost entirely of manuscript drafts, edits, notes and galleys
            for the award-winning <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph>, published in 1983. The
            novel, also set in Albany during the Depression, continues the story of the Phelan
            family. It focuses on Billy Phelan's father Francis, an alcoholic wanderer who returns
            to the city. Among its many honors, <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph> received the
            National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction in 1983 and the Pulitzer Prize for
            Fiction in 1984.</p>
          <p>The files document the evolution of the book from a short novel called <emph render="italic">The Lemon Weed</emph> about an alcoholic named Buddy, based upon an
            actual man Kennedy met and repeatedly interviewed during the 1960s. Of interest are
            photographs of men and women like Buddy in the streets and missions, taken by a
            photojournalist friend of Kennedy's and included in the first draft of <emph render="italic">The Lemon Weed</emph> for Subsistence Press.</p>
          <p>Please see Series 8, <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph> (Film Version), for
            materials documenting the transition of the book to film.</p>

          <p> Published in 1983, William Kennedy's nonfiction work <emph render="italic">O
              Albany!</emph> is based upon a series of articles he wrote about the city for the
            Albany <emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph> in the early-mid 1960s, which garnered
            him a Pulitzer Prize nomination for journalism. The book looks at Albany neighborhoods,
            different ethnic and racial groups who settled within the city, landmarks and
            institutions, and key political leaders. The series includes manuscripts and draft copy,
            Kennedy's earlier newspaper features, research materials and notes. As all the materials
            span a significant amount of time, please note the overall dates for this series are not

          <p> This series contains materials related to two children's books that William Kennedy
            wrote with his son Brendan; <emph render="italic">Charlie Malarkey and the Belly Button
              Machine</emph>, published in 1986, and <emph render="italic">Charlie Malarkey and the
              Singing Moose</emph>, which appeared in print in 1993. The series features working and
            edited drafts, galleys, newspaper clippings, reviews, and press tour materials. There
            also are several folders of correspondence. The files document the difficulties Kennedy
            encountered in attempting to publish the first book, including many rejection letters
            from publishing houses beginning in 1975. Of additional interest is correspondence about
            illustrations, foreign editions, possible film deals, and letters and a book from
            children who enjoyed the stories. </p>

          <p> In the summer of 1983 William Kennedy accepted director Francis Ford Coppola's
            invitation to collaborate with him on a film script for <emph render="italic">The Cotton
              Club</emph>, a 1930s period drama built around the real Harlem night club in New York.
            He spent the remainder of that summer and the fall writing and editing, as the movie
            transitioned from the pre-production phase to principal photography. The film debuted in
            the United States in 1984. This series documents that intensive writing and re-writing
            effort with many working scripts, rehearsal scripts, shooting scripts, and editing
            scripts. In addition, there are production memos and notes, call sheets, publicity
            materials, reviews, correspondence, and a file about the movie premiere.</p>

          <p> This series documents the transition of <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph> from the
            1983 award-winning novel to film in 1987. Like the book, the movie focuses on the
            character of Francis Phelan and his return to Albany during the Depression. William
            Kennedy wrote the script for the film which was directed by Hector Babenco and starred
            Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. It was filmed on location in Albany and the surrounding
            areas. The materials include many draft and edited scripts, publicity materials,
            information about casting and locations, call sheets, correspondence, reviews, and two
            paperback copies of the novel with notes used for script writing. Note the overall dates
            for the series are not inclusive.</p>
          <p>Please see Series 4, <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph>, for materials related to

          <p> Contains drafts, edited copies, the final version, and galleys of <emph render="italic">Quinn's Book</emph>, published by William Kennedy in 1988. Part of the
            "Albany Cycle," this novel also involves the extended Phelan family, but focuses on the
            nineteenth century life and adventures of an ancestor named Daniel Quinn. There are many
            edited and unedited versions of the manuscript; however, the majority of copies are
            undated. The archivist tried to arrange these undated drafts in chronological order
            based upon the edits in each version.</p>

          <p> William Kennedy continued his writings about the Phelan family with <emph render="italic">Very Old Bones</emph>, his next installment in the "Albany Cycle" of
            novels published in 1992. This book is set in the 1950s in the city and narrated by
            Orson Purcell, the out-of-wedlock son of Peter Phelan. The majority of the series
            consists of manuscript drafts and edited copy, although there are a small number of
            files containing correspondence, publicity materials, articles and reviews, and excerpts
            of the novel published in magazines.</p>

          <p> This series includes draft copy, galleys, research materials, correspondence, and
            notes used to prepare William Kennedy's <emph render="italic">Riding the Yellow Trolley
              Car</emph>, a collection of his essays, articles, and reviews written across four
            decades. This second nonfiction book from Kennedy appeared in 1993. Of note is the
            earliest item within the collection, a short story entitled "Eggs" from 1946 which
            Kennedy submitted to <emph render="italic">Collier's: The National Weekly</emph> for
            consideration. In addition there are files about publicity, including a book tour,
            reviews, and fan mail. Please note the overall dates for the series are not
            inclusive.</p>

          <p> In 1996 and 2002 publishers packaged together several of William Kennedy's "Albany
            Cycle" novels into single volumes for release in the United States and international
            market. In 1996 Penguin Books released <emph render="italic">Legs</emph>, <emph render="italic">Billy Phelan's Greatest Game</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph> together for the first time with a new author's introduction. Six
            years later Scribner, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster UK, published two books each
            containing three re-issued "Albany Cycle" novels. The first consisted of <emph render="italic">Billy Phelan's Greatest Game</emph>, <emph render="italic">Ironweed</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Very Old Bones</emph>. The second featured
              <emph render="italic">Quinn's Book</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Flaming
              Corsage</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Legs</emph>. This series includes materials
            related to these publications as well as a 1976 outline by Kennedy of his vision for the
            "Albany Cycle" of planned books, and correspondence and proposed artwork for paperback
            copies of "Albany Cycle" novels issued from Penguin in 2002.</p>

          <p> This series contains correspondence sent to William Kennedy from fellow authors,
            journalists, politicians, and members of the film industry. Most notably, the files
            document his relationships with other well-known writers of American literature,
            especially his decades-long friendships with mentor Saul Bellow and Hunter S. Thompson.
            Also included is correspondence with Philip Roth, Joyce Carol Oates, Frank McCourt,
            Doris Grumbach, John Updike, and more. Materials include letters, greeting cards, post
            cards, fax transmissions, e-mail and one Western Union mailgram. Nearly all of the other
            series also include correspondence related to the respective series.</p>

          <p> This series consists of draft articles, background research materials, memos, notes,
            magazine and newspaper clippings on a number of subjects that William Kennedy explored
            and reported upon, especially for his Pulitzer Prize nominated series of features for
            the Albany <emph render="italic">Times-Union</emph> during the mid-1960s. Those articles
            included investigations into Albany slums, poverty, housing integration, and racial
            inequalities. While the initial copy appeared in the 1960s, the files in this series
            document Kennedy's continued interest and active research of the same topics in
            subsequent decades. Kennedy used the materials on slums as background for <emph render="italic">O Albany!</emph>. Please note the overall dates for the series are not
            inclusive.</p>

          <p> This series features biographical materials about William Kennedy. The majority of
            documents are news clippings about his work, book reviews and analysis, profile pieces,
            interview transcripts, articles featuring Kennedy's insights and comments on literature
            and the arts, and related correspondence. Of interest are newspaper clips and a program
            from Kennedy's first play <emph render="italic">Grand View</emph> which debuted at the
            Capital Repertory Theatre in Albany in 1996. There also is a VHS tape of <emph render="italic">William Kennedy's Albany</emph> which aired on PBS and a file
            discussing the celebration of the acquisition of this collection by the University at
            Albany. For articles written by Kennedy see Series 15: Essays and Articles or Series 17:
            Investigative Journalism. </p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p> In 1995 William Kennedy accompanied President Bill Clinton to Northern Ireland and the
            Republic of Ireland as part of an American delegation, following a cease fire between
            the Irish Republican Army and the Loyalist Military Command in Northern Ireland in 1994.
            The delegation included elected officials, business, labor, religious, and community
            leaders and was designed to promote both peace and U.S. investment. This series
            documents that particular trip, including invitations, arrangements, news clips, maps,
            travel items, correspondence, and backgrounders. In addition, Kennedy and his wife
            attended a White House dinner in 1996 given by the Clintons in honor of the President of
            Ireland, Mary Robinson, and the first State visit by an Irish president in more than 30
            years. The invitation and dinner menu and related correspondence also are included. </p>
