      <abstract label="Abstract:">The Public Employees Federation (PEF) was founded in 1979 to represent members of the Professional, Scientific, and Technical (PS&amp;T) bargaining unit of New York State. PS&amp;T employees had formerly been represented by CSEA, the state’s largest public employee union. PEF founders believed that the concerns of the PS&amp;T unit were not adequately represented by CSEA, the majority of whose members were non-professional state employees. PEF’s stated mission is to “provide the leadership necessary for PEF members to achieve employment security, higher wages, better working conditions, and improved retirement benefits.” Materials in this collection document PEF activities at both the state and division level. There is extensive coverage of executive board activities from 1978 through mid-2000, annual conventions, committee meetings, and contract negotiations. Also included are files for PEF Division 169, PEF’s Environmental Conservation Division. These include correspondence, agendas and minutes for labor/management meetings, material on committees, and administrative files. This collection also documents the activities of reform groups and political parties within PEF (most notably, the Statewide Coalition for a Democratic Union) and PEF’s relationships with its national affiliates, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers. Particularly strong is the collection of bulletin board postings, which includes almost everything posted on Division 169 PEF bulletin boards from 1979 through 2000. There are also official PEF publications, including a near-complete run of PEF’s official monthly newsletter to members, <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph>.</abstract>

      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Public Employees Federation (PEF) was certified in 1979 as the collective bargaining agent for the members of the Professional, Scientific, and Technical (PS&amp;T) unit of New York State. This unit includes scientists, doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, social workers, counselors, and a wide variety of other professionals employed throughout New York. ["This Is PEF", Series 6, Box 1, Folder 17]. PS&amp;T employees had formerly been represented by CSEA, the state's largest public employee union. PEF founders believed that the concerns of the PS&amp;T unit were not adequately represented by CSEA, the majority of whose members were non-professional state employees. After these employees voted in April 1978 to be represented by PEF rather than CSEA, CSEA launched a legal attack against PEF to stop the loss of some 45,000 members to the new union. The legal battle continued through early 1979; CSEA charged PEF organizers with forging thousands of signatures on ballots in the PS&amp;T vote on PEF representation. These charges were eventually deemed to be unfounded by the New York State Court of Appeals in March 1979, and PEF was legally certified as the collective bargaining agent for PS&amp;T employees. [ "PEF - 1978 to 1988", <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph>, Convention Supplement, October 1988, Series 6, Oversize Box 2, Folder 4].</p>
      <p>PEF began negotiating its first contract with the state on April 23, 1979. The contract was accepted by members in December 1979, against the recommendation of the Executive Board. ["PEF - 1978 to 1988", <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph>, Convention Supplement, October 1988, Series 6, Oversize Box 2, Folder 4]. Contracts were originally negotiated for a three-year period; in 1991, a four-year contract was negotiated for the first time. [1991-1995 Professional, Scientific, and Technical Unit Contract, Series 1, Box 2, Folder 25]. In many cases, negotiations with the state on a given contract were so prolonged that the previous contract expired before a new one took effect. This usually led to controversy regarding "sunset" benefits, provisions of the expired contract which the State refused to honor when a new contract had not been agreed upon.</p>
      <p>One contract issue of primary concern to PEF in the years documented by this collection was the state retirement system. In the 1970s New York State implemented a tiered retirement system, in which workers' retirement benefits varied considerably based on their original date of hire. PEF has long lobbied for the abolishment of the tier system, but has not been successful. Other issues of long-term concern for PEF include maintaining a high level of health care coverage for its members, preventing the outsourcing of state jobs to private contractors, preventing layoffs in the face of state budget cuts, insuring timely and fair performance evaluations, and guaranteeing parking privileges for members working in downtown Albany.</p>
      <p>Political controversy within the union was common in its early years. PEF's first president, John Kraemer, was investigated on charges of being a "no-show" employee at his previous position with the New York State Department of Labor. [Personnel Abuses at the Department of Labor", State of New York Commission of Investigation, July 1979, Series 1, Box 4, Folder 49]. After being voted out of office in 1982, Kraemer was convicted of embezzling funds from the union. ["Unionist's Career a Stormy One", Albany <emph render="italic">Times Union</emph>, 6 March 1987, Series 1, Box 4, Folder 49]. Kraemer's successor, Elizabeth Hoke, caused controversy by revoking the union leave of PEF's three statewide vice presidents. ["Unions Open Query Into PEF Dispute", Albany <emph render="italic">Times Union</emph>, 24 May 1984, Series 4, Box 3, Folder 38]. Later, she was charged with using her PEF credit card for personal expenses. ["Hoke 'Censors' Union Article on Credit Card Use", Albany <emph render="italic">Times Union</emph>,11 September 1984, Series 4, Box 3, Folder 38]. The Statewide Coalition for a Democratic Union (SCDU), a group dedicated to reforming PEF, had originally backed Hoke's election bid; by 1985, they had renounced their support of her and actively supported opponent Rand Condell's presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>As of 1999, PEF represented approximately 55,000 workers throughout New York State. Five full-time officers are elected by union members: a president, three vice-presidents, and a secretary-treasurer. Three elected trustees serve as independent monitors of PEF's finances. Members also elect 1000 delegates to an annual convention where major policy decisions are made. A 120-member executive board handles policy decisions between conventions. At the local level, members elect officers and shop stewards in about 230 local divisions, each of which represents PEF workers in a specific building or facility. PEF is also divided into 12 geographical regions, each with a regional office and member-elected coordinator. ["This Is PEF", Series 6, Box 1, Folder 17].</p>
      <p>PEF divisions are the equivalent of what most other unions call locals. Divisions, usually based around a given state agency or workplace, began to form in May 1981. ["PEF - 1978 to 1988", <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph>, Convention Supplement, October 1988, Series 6, Oversize Box 2, Folder 4]. Division 169 consists of PEF members employed by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) throughout New York State, excluding Long Island. Division 169 is also referred to as PEF/ENCON.</p>
      <p>PEF's stated mission is to "provide the leadership necessary for PEF members to achieve employment security, higher wages, better working conditions, and improved retirement benefits". ["Mission", http://www.pef.org/, 25 June 2004]. PEF is affiliated with New York State United Teachers, the American Federation of Teachers and the Service Employees International Union. ["This Is PEF", Series 6, Box 1, Folder 17].</p>
      <p>During the years covered by this collection, PEF presidents were John Kraemer (1979-1982), Elizabeth Hoke (1982-1985), Rand Condell (1985-1991), Howard Schafer (1991-1994), James Sheedy (1994-1997), and Roger Benson (1997- ).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>Materials in this collection document PEF activities at both the state and division level. Contract negotiations were a central activity of the union and are well-documented. Other statewide activities include PEF's annual convention, held throughout New York in locations that included Niagara Falls, Syracuse, and Buffalo. There is extensive coverage of executive board meetings from the board's inception in 1978 through mid-2000; meeting kits for each meeting contain agendas, minutes, memos and correspondence, news clippings on issues relevant to board discussions, and a wealth of other materials. The executive board held regular meetings on a quarterly basis; special meetings were held at PEF's annual convention or when extenuating circumstances warranted additional meetings, such as when the Executive Board needed to vote on whether to send a proposed contract to PEF members for final approval. There is also documentation of statewide lobbying and campaigning activity through the Political Action Committee, as well as documentation of other state and local committee activities. There is some documentation of both state and local Women's Program meetings and events.</p>
      <p>This collection also documents PEF's relationship with its affiliate unions, the American Federation of Teachers, New York State United Teachers, and the Service Employees International Union. In 1983, PEF president Elizabeth Hoke took legal action to sever PEF's affiliate relationships, arguing that the affiliation agreements were exploitative. The New York State Supreme Court ruled against PEF, and the affiliate relationships were maintained. The collection contains extensive coverage of the affiliation dispute case. There are also files on conventions held by PEF's affiliates.</p>
      <p>Also included are many files for PEF Division 169, PEF's Environmental Conservation Division (frequently referred to as PEF/ENCON). These include correspondence between the Division and PEF headquarters, agendas and minutes for labor/management meetings, committee files, and administrative files. Particularly strong is the collection of bulletin board postings, which includes almost everything posted from 1979 to 2000 on Division 169 PEF bulletin boards. New York State was contractually required to provide these bulletin boards to PEF for communication with members.</p>
      <p>This collection also documents the activities of reform groups and political parties within PEF - most notably, the Statewide Coalition for a Democratic Union (SCDU), which was active in the presidential campaigns of both Elizabeth Hoke (1982) and Rand Condell (1985, 1988).</p>
      <p>The collection is particularly strong in official PEF publications. Included is a near-complete run of PEF's official monthly newsletter to members, <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph>, dating from 1979-1990 and 1994-1999. Other publications include <emph render="italic">Steward News</emph>, <emph render="italic">Shop Talk</emph>, contract update newsletters, retirees' newsletters, and several regional and divisional newsletters.</p>
      <p>This collection does not provide much documentation of division activities outside of Division 169, nor of regional activities beyond region 8, which encompasses the Capital District. The collection also lacks material related to rank-and-file members and the effect of the union on their lives. It contains no membership rosters for either the state or division level.</p>

          <p>This series includes administrative files for both statewide PEF operations and Division 169. Where necessary, files related to statewide PEF are marked as "New York State PEF" to prevent confusion. Division 169-specific files are marked as "Division 169". There are numerous subject files. The collection's creator did not distinguish between subject and administrative files. This series includes files related to contracts and contract negotiations, PEF's relationships with its affiliates, PEF history, constitutions and by-laws, elections, retirement plans, health insurance and other benefits, PEF policy, steward training, and many other aspects of PEF and Division 169 operations. There are a number of designated correspondence files; however, correspondence is also found throughout this series and others in subject files.</p>

          <p>This series contains files related to Division 169's relationship with the Department of Environmental Conservation, the agency by which its members were employed. The heart of the series consists of minutes and agendas for labor/management meetings. These contractually-mandated meetings between PEF representatives and DEC managers took place several times each year. At these meetings, issues related to interpretation of the current PEF contract were discussed. Also included are files on DEC policies and operations, subject files on issues that were discussed at labor/management meetings, and files on DEC-specific PEF committees. The Health and Safety Committee files in this series relate to the PEF/ENCON - DEC Joint Statewide Health and Safety Committee, which should not be confused with the statewide PEF Health and Safety Committee. Files from statewide PEF's Health and Safety Committee are found in Series 4.</p>

          <p>The bulk of this series consists of executive board meeting kits, which contain all material furnished to board members in advance of a scheduled meeting. This material usually includes a proposed agenda and minutes from the previous meeting for approval. Also included are correspondence and memos related to the meeting and to issues on the proposed agenda, as well as committee reports addressed to the president and executive board. Materials that were sometimes included are policy documents, financial documents and drafts of proposed annual budgets, and ethics grievance petitions. The Executive Board could choose to hear appeals of cases that had been previously decided by the Ethics Committee. A few folders contain handwritten notes taken at the meetings.</p>
          <p>Although the executive board meeting kits cover the period from 1979 through mid-2000, there are some gaps in coverage. Most significantly, there are no executive board kits for the period from July 1988 through July 1991. There is also no kit from the first quarter of 1997, and no kits for the period from June 1997 through November 1998.</p>
          <p>Also included in this series are executive board materials not associated with a particular meeting. Particularly notable are correspondence and news clippings detailing the founding of PEF, its struggle for legal recognition, and the formation of the original interim executive board during the period 1978-1979.</p>

          <p>This series contains records of PEF committee activities at both the state and local level, along with information on a wide range of other programs and events. Particularly notable is coverage of PEF annual conventions from 1979-2000, although not all years are included; the statewide and regional Political Action Committees; the Women's Program; the statewide Health and Safety Committee; Leadership Development Conferences, and the Public Service Training Program.</p>
          <p>There is also significant coverage of conventions held by PEF's affiliates: the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the New York State Union of Teachers (NYSUT), and the Services Employees International Union (SEIU).</p>
          <p>Also included are files on political parties and reform groups within PEF; most significantly, the Statewide Coalition for a Democratic Union and the Pro-Member Party.</p>
          <p>Not included are committees, programs, and events connected to labor/management relations between Division 169 and the Department of Environmental Conservation or to the Executive Board. These are found in Series 2 and Series 3, respectively. Also not included are subject files on organizations with no direct PEF connection. These files are found in Series 1.</p>

          <p>This series contains materials posted by stewards on contract-mandated PEF bulletin boards at the Department of Environmental Conservation main offices in Albany. Included are a wide variety of materials of interest to PEF members, such as photocopies of correspondence on issues that affected members, news clippings of PEF and union-related articles, contract negotiation updates, and statewide union election information. There is also a great deal of information related to union activity at the local level, including political action events, local steward elections, and weekly steward meetings (including steward meeting attendance records).</p>
          <p>Although attempts have been made to maintain chronological order in this series, many items had no posting date. Some of these items were marked with a removal date, but it was often difficult to determine how long they had been posted prior to their removal.</p>
          <p>The series is mostly complete for the years 1979-2000; however, there are a few months for which there is no bulletin board material.</p>

          <p>This series consists of official PEF publications, as well as publications produced by other entities collected by PEF.</p>
          <p>Statewide PEF publications include <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph>, PEF's official newspaper. The Communicator usually appeared monthly, although during some periods it was published semi-monthly. The run of <emph render="italic">The Communicator</emph> in this series is near-complete for the periods from 1979 through 1990 and from May 1994 through January 1999. There are numerous other statewide PEF publications as well, including <emph render="italic">Steward News</emph>, <emph render="italic">Contract Update</emph>, and newsletters for the women's and retirees' programs. In addition to these statewide publications, there are select issues of regional and divisional news publications.</p>
          <p>Non-PEF publications include newsletters produced by the New York Office of Employee Relations and the Civil Service Department.</p>
          <p>Statewide PEF publications are alphabetized by title. Publications produced by specific regions or divisions, as well as non-PEF publications, are alphabetized first by the name of the entity that produced them, then by title. There are several folders containing publications with more than one title - for example, the "Contracts Newsletter" folder and folders that contain newsletters from multiple regions and divisions. These folders are given titles that indicate the source of the publications.</p>
          <p>Committee or task force reports that were professionally printed for distribution are not included in this series. They can be found with the files of their respective creators in other series. For example, reports printed for PEF conventions are found in Series 4, under the heading of the convention at which they were distributed.</p>

          <p>News clippings appear throughout the collection in files relating to specific topics, particularly in Series 1, Series 2, and Series 4. This series consists of news clippings that were not organized by subject. Most were collected by PEF's central office for distribution within PEF, but some (particularly in later years) were collected by PEF/ENCON. In many cases, the letterhead onto which the clippings were photocopied indicate whether the clipping came from the central office or the ENCON division.</p>
          <p>News clippings include material about PEF itself, as well as material about other New York State labor unions and issues of interest to PEF and PEF/ENCON.
