      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs was created in 1965 to oversee a variety of aspects of student life at the University, including: residental life, counseling, athletics, financial aid, student activities, and health services.  Most of these duties had previously been overseen by the Deans of Men and Women.  The position of Vice President for Student Affairs was replaced by the Dean of Student Affairs (also referred to as Dean of Students) in 1972; the position reverted to a Vice Presidency in 1983.  The Office was later renamed the Division of Student Success, but as of 2017 it is once again referred to as the Division of Student Affairs.</p>
