      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>Carleton Simon was born on the 28th of February 1871 in New York City and attended 
				college in Vienna and Paris, graduating with an M.D. in 1890. In 1893, he married 
				Monetta Worthington Marler. The couple had two children, Rosa and Carleton, 
				Jr. </p>
      <p>A psychiatrist by profession, Simon became interested in the criminal mind, 
				and that interest eventually led to his career as a criminologist. In 1901, 
				Simon conducted a psychiatric study of Leon Czolgosz, the assassin of President 
				McKinley. Also in 1901, he studied the water cure, a torture used by the U.S. 
				Army to interrogate Philippine prisoners, at the request of the <emph render="italic">New York Herald.</emph> 
				His findings led to the abolition 
				of this form of questioning.</p>
      <p>Phrenology was an early interest of Simon's. In 1904, George Francis Train, 
				an American eccentric who financed the Union Pacific Railway, built the first 
				tramway in England and ran the first clipper ships to Australia, left his brain 
				to Simon, who dissected it and made a report to the American Institute of Phrenology. 
				Carleton Simon also believed that the face was an indicator of personality and 
				that a criminal's face was therefore a mirror into his actions; Some facial 
				characteristics Simon believed were congenital, but most he thought were caused 
				by the etching of experience on the face.</p>
      <p>From 1918 to 1920, Simon examined addicts for the New York State Narcotic Commission. 
				In 1920, he was appointed Special Deputy Police Commissioner in charge of the 
				Narcotics Bureau. Simon was credited with increasing the number of people arrested 
				for drug related crimes, In 1921, Simon was also responsible for the formation 
				of the International Narcotic Criminal Identification Bureau which collected records, 
				including photography and fingerprints, an over 100,000 people convicted 
				of narcotic-connected crimes in 700 cities in the United States and 27 foreign 
				countries. Following his tenure as deputy commissioner, Simon compiled a narcotic 
				survey for the state of Louisiana which estimated the number of addicts and the extent 
				of drug trafficking in the state.</p>
      <p>From 1928 to 1938, Simon served as special adviser to the Will Hays Commission, 
				which developed a production code that all the movie studios agreed to follow. 
				Simon's role was to read proposed film scripts and to watch movies to ensure 
				that crime was not being glorified. He also advised about whether certain films 
				were indirect causes to specific crimes.</p>
      <p>Simon was an advocate of universal, compulsory fingerprinting and of the use 
				of identification badges as means of establishing positive identity. In 1936 
				he and Dr. Isadore Goldstein developed a retinal method of identification whereby 
				a photograph was made of the pattern of blood vessels of the retina. This method 
				was supposed to be superior to fingerprinting because the pattern of blood vessels 
				could not be changed whereas fingerprints could at least be disfigured. </p>
      <p>Carleton Simon had other interests besides criminology. He was known as "The 
				Father of Casting" and was World Surf Casting Champion from 1914 to 1919. In 
				1914, he organized the Association of Surf Angling Clubs. He wrote about fish 
				and fishing under the pseudonyms Baron Munchausen, Grape Juice, and John O'Neill. 
				He also wrote poems, a few of which were published in newspaper, under the name 
				"The Ancient Mariner," Carlisle Simon, his own name and anonymously. At least 
				a couple of police stories that fictionalized his experience at the NY Police 
				Department were published under the name Charles Somerville. </p>
      <p>Carleton Simon continued to present his ideal as a criminologist to
				the public in his last years. He gave addresses, often to law enforcement
				organizations, and continued to write. He was the criminologist for the
				New York State and the New England associations for Chiefs of Police. He
				died an the eighteenth of February 1951, just before his eightieth birthday.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The bulk of this collection consists of the writings of Carleton Simon, mostly 
				on crime, but also included are a couple of stories published under a pseudonym 
				in a detective fiction magazine and a few poems. The pamphlets and other published 
				writings, together with the unpublished writings, give fairly complete view 
				of Simon's ideas on crime and criminology. Although Simon was particularly interested 
				in crimes related to narcotics, his pamphlets and speeches show an interest 
				in a wide range of crimes and in examining the causes of crime and how those 
				might be eliminated. Some of his pamphlets are missing from this collection, 
				notably one written about his examination of Leon Czolgosz. In addition, there 
				is no documentation in the collection of his research of the water cure at the 
				request of the <emph render="italic">New York Herald.</emph></p>
      <p>Many of his unpublished writings are speeches to law enforcement groups and 
				a few of these pieces are drafts of published essays. Besides these, there are 
				a few books that Simon had worked on. One, "Spotting the Junkies", seems to 
				be nearly finished, but it was never published. The book is a description of 
				the lives of drug addicts, and it includes many illustrations, mostly of drug 
				paraphernalia. There is also a folder titled "Criminal Word Book" which apparently 
				was intended to be a glossary of criminals' slang. This work appears to be an 
				early draft and consists of little more than illustrations many of which seem 
				to have been borrowed from the manuscript for "Spotting the Junkies". A third 
				unpublished work consists of two draft chapters describing the lives of individual 
				addicts. </p>
      <p>The correspondence and newspaper clippings contain articles about Simon's work 
				and a few letters, notably his correspondence with Sir Percy Sillitoe, a Scottish 
				law enforcement officer. Also included are subject files on specific projects 
				of Simon's: his psychiatric clinic in the Bowery Mission, his part in proving 
				the sanity of a Swedish immigrant, May Johnson, and his interest in his friend 
				George Francis Train. </p>
      <p>The series on the Hay's Code contains reports by Simon on the suitability of 
				certain movies and scripts. It shows the morals of the time and how the movie 
				industry attempted to protect itself from public censure by developing a commission 
				that would devise and regulate a production code A the entire movie industry. 
				Simon appears to have been chosen to report on films that use crime as a central 
				element in the plot because of his renown as a criminologist. Simon's role was 
				to determine if any of the films glorified crime or the actions of criminals. 
			</p>
      <p>The biographical files contain distilled information 	about Simon's accomplishments
				which are augmented by the published news stories about his work as a criminologist.</p>
