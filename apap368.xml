      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>A native of Gloversville, New York, Peter G. Pollak obtained his bachelor's degree from Oberlin College and later received his master's and doctoral degrees from the University at Albany, SUNY. Pollak was active in the civil rights movement and was a VISTA (Volunteeers in Service to America) anti-poverty volunteer in Atlanta before coming to the Unviersity at Albany.</p>
      <p> While in Albany, he continued to be engaged in activism on a community and broader level. He served as managing editor of <emph render="italic">The Albany Liberator</emph>, a weekly newspaper designed to serve the needs of the city's Arbor Hill and South End communitities. The publication was owned and published by The Brothers, an area civil rights group. Pollak also was a member of the Albany Region/Capital District chapter of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society). In addition, he helped lead an unsuccessful fight to establish a day care center at the University in the early 1970s.</p>
      <p> Today following a career spent teaching, editing, and in business, he is a self published author.</p>
