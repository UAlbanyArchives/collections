      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Gerhard Colm was best known for his work as the Chief Economist of the National Planning Association and serving as a leading economic adviser for both the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.</p>
      <p>Gerhard Colm was born on June 30, 1897 in Hamburg, Germany to Emil and Olga Strassburger Colm. He received his doctorate in 1921 from the University of Frieburg and did post-graduate work at the University of Munich and the University of Berlin (1921-1922). Colm served as a statistician for the German government from 1921-1927, but left government service to enter academia as head of the research division of the Institute of World Economics at the University of Kiel from 1927-1933.</p>
      <p>Colm's active participation in groups agitating against the Freikorps and other pro-Hitler organizations forced him to emigrate in 1933 to the United States as a refugee from Nazi Germany. Colm came to New York as one of the founding members of the University in Exile of the New School for Social Research, to which he was elected Dean of Exiled Scholars in 1938.</p>
      <p>In 1939 Colm was named by Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins as Fiscal and Financial expert of the new industrial economics division of that department. In this capacity Colm developed national income estimates for economic planning. One year later Colm became principal fiscal analyst of the Bureau of the Budget and assistant chief of the division, a position he held until 1946. In addition, Colm lectured at George Washington University from 1940-1962 and served the U.S. government on many special economic missions to foreign countries. From 1946 to 1952 he was economist on the Council of Economic Advisors, Executive Office of the President. In 1952 Colm joined the private sector as Chief Economist for the National Planning Association, remaining in that position until his death. He died on December 26, 1968 in Chevy Chase, Maryland.</p>
      <p>Colm was married twice, first to Hanna Nicolassen on September 11, 1922 until her death on March 21, 1965. They had four children, Peter, Ann, Stine and Claus. Colm married his second wife, Mascha Gilde on April 11, 1966.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Gerhard Colm Papers, 1929-1972, (2 cu. ft.) have been divided into seven series: 1) Biographical materials; 2) Correspondence of Gerhard Colm, 1929-1967; 3) Hans Staudinger Correspondence,1969-1972; 4) Writings and publications of Gerhard Colm, 1930-1967; 5) Publications and papers prepared by Colm (or under his supervision) for the National Planning Association, 1952-1968; 6) Manuscripts by others; and 7) Miscellaneous materials.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of Colm's writings, both private publications (1930-1967) as well as those published under the auspices of the National Planning Association (1952-1968).
