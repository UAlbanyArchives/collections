      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Board of Trustees of the State University of New York established the School of Social Welfare in December of 1963. Impetus for creation of the School came as a result of two
        reports, the Moreland Commission Report in January of 1963 and the New York State Committee
        Report on Medical Education in June of 1963. Both reports concluded that the State of New
        York faced critical shortage of social workers. As one means of alleviating this shortage, a
        new School of Social Welfare was proposed situated on the campus of the State University of
        New York at Albany (SUNYA).</p>
      <p>In 1964, Dr. Richardson L. Rice was appointed the school's first dean and began efforts to
        establish a two-year master's program in social welfare. The first class of twenty-seven
        students entered the master's program in the fall of 1965 and graduated on June 11, 1967.
        The Council of Social Work Education (CSWE) granted accreditation for the master's program
        in 1969.</p>
      <p>1968 saw the founding of the associated Institute of Gerontology. The study of aging would
        later develop into a major research and teaching emphasis of the School of Social Welfare.
        From 1981 to 1997, in recognition of the support received from Rhoda and Stan Ringel, the
        Institute was called the Ringel Institute of Gerontology. </p>
      <p>In 1970, the University Senate approved the bachelor's degree program in Social Welfare and
        initial consideration was given to a proposal for a Ph. D. program. The undergraduate course
        offerings began in the 1970-1971 school year, and the Schools' master's program was
        reaccredited. A broadening of the curriculum also occurred with the addition of required
        courses in geriatrics, social policy analysis, and program development. Social policy
        analysis became a formal area of concentration and the School added a new concentration in
        Social Welfare Administration to the curriculum.</p>
      <p>The early 1970s saw a rising chorus of demands for SUNYA to become active in working for
        social change. The School of Social Welfare responded to this demand by continuing its
        pursuit of minority students and faculty, and creating a number of programs that focused on
        social problems. A Social Service Study Unit was created to refer student volunteers to
        local agencies. A Neighborhood Services Unit (renamed the Neighborhood Outreach Unit in
        1973) was also created to provide assistance to inner city residents. Stationed in Arbor
        Hill, this unit functioned as a clinical teaching facility, providing counseling to married
        couples and aid to senior citizens. Together these two programs constituted the Community
        Service Program, designed to involve enrolled students in volunteer social work.</p>
      <p>Despite the decline in federal support and the precarious nature of state finances during
        the early 1970s, the School launched a number of new initiatives. In the fall of 1972, a
        full undergraduate major was offered leading to a B.S. degree. By the spring of 1973 the
        undergraduate degree program was accredited. The School introduced field instruction in
        1973-1974 with courses offered in state and private agencies where staff and personnel
        supervised and instructed enrolled students. The 1972-1973 school year saw the newly created
        Institute of Gerontology collaborate with the State Office for the Aging in research
        projects.</p>
      <p>In the face of continued fiscal strain, the School launched new programs in continuing
        education during 1974-1975. These included an extended study management program and a
        comprehensive education program for child welfare workers. Both concentrated on problems
        associated with child abuse and were designed to allow part-time study toward a professional
        degree. By 1976 these programs enrolled 750 county and state agency personnel. The
        relationships established between the School and outside community agencies and institutions
        helped the School obtain $1.3 million dollars in grants.</p>
      <p>The State of New York, as well as the various regional agencies, sought to use the School's
        expertise to solve pressing social problems. In 1976, the State requested services to aid
        with the Temporary State Commission on Child Welfare. The State wanted to develop a new
        legal service manual for child welfare workers, overhaul state laws concerning child welfare
        and institute new training programs for social workers. The School contributed to these
        goals by creating the Continuing Education Project, later renamed the Continuing Education
        Program (CEP), during 1975-1976 to extend educational opportunities to state and local
        social service agencies and by sponsoring numerous educational conferences.</p>
      <p>The creation of the Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy in 1981-1982
        and the incorporation of the School of Social Welfare into the College signaled renewed
        growth for the School. The first evidence of this development was the establishment of an
        accelerated bachelor's/master's degree program offering a shortened program (12 months
        instead of 18). The school also implemented program changes to meet the needs of part-time
        students. The SUNY Board of Trustees approved the long-planned Ph. D. in Social Welfare in
        1982, and the program accepted its first doctoral candidates in 1984.</p>
      <p>The creation of Rockefeller College provided impetus for the School of Social Welfare to
        pool its resources with other schools in the College. By the mid-1980s the School cooperated
        in a number of endeavors with the Schools of Criminal Justice, Public Administration, and
        Public Policy. Plans were also made to create a graduate program incorporating Health Policy
        and Management.</p>
      <p>Currently, the School of Social Welfare offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees
        with B.S.W. and M.S.W. programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education, the
        national accrediting body. There continues to be a strong emphasis on community engagement
        at the local level, and research and field work opportunities are now global in scope 
        with international programs in Ireland, South Africa, South Korea, Russia, Peru, and other
        countries.</p>
      <p>In line with community engagement, the School maintains a commitment to investigation of
        the evolving human needs of the 21st century. To achieve this goal the School offers a broad
        spectrum of research opportunities through various research centers and institutes,
        including the Center for Excellence in Aging Services and Community Wellness, the Center for
        Human Services Research, the Center for Innovation in Mental Health Research, the Institute
        of Gerontology, the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute, and the New York State
        Social Work Education Consortium.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of the School of Social Welfare span from the School's first full year of operation
        in 1964 to 2000. Early records relating to the founding of the School include annual reports
        from 1967-1968 through 1977-1978, accreditation reports and internal self-studies from
        1966-1975, proposals for the bachelor's, master's, and the Ph. D. programs, faculty meeting
        minutes from 1965-1971, and various School of Social Welfare bulletins from the 1960s and
        1970s. The bulk of the materials, however, document the day-to-day operations of the School
        from 1990-2000, during Lynn Videcka-Sherman's tenure as dean. There is little correspondence
        or other communication from deans prior to Videcka-Sherman. A significant portion of the
        records consist of publications from the Resource Guide Series produced by the Continuing
        Education Program, ranging from 1973-1990. </p>

          <p>Most materials from this series relate to the period from 1990-2000, during which time
            Lynn Videcka-Sherman was dean of the School of Social Welfare. These materials represent
            the day-to-day files from the dean’s office, and include correspondence and other
            communication throughout the series. There is a sizeable amount of materials relating to
            the National Association of Deans and Directors of Social Work (NADD), including agendas
            and planning documents for annual meetings. Lynn Videcka-Sherman acted as president of
            NADD from 1993-1995 and the materials reflect her time with the organization. Other
            associations represented include the New York State Association of Deans of Social Work
            Schools and the New York Chapter of the National Association of Social Work.</p>
          <p>In 1997 a shift in record keeping occurred with a new system of filing all
            communications and day-to-day documents in folders labeled generically as "day file."
            This shift differed from the previous method of filing dean's correspondence and
            memoranda in separate folders for each year and of creating more specific folders for
            other materials. The archivist elected to maintain original order of the materials.</p>

          <p>The majority of the Administrative series includes annual reports for the School of
            Social Welfare and the Continuing Education Program, and a variety of budgetary reports
            for programs within the School of Social Welfare. Correspondence and memoranda relating
            to administrative and budgetary issues are also included, with a large portion relating
            to the executive order for a hiring freeze by Governor George Pataki in January 1995 in
            response to the 1995-1996 New York State budget deficit. These documents and
            communication outline contingency plans and scenarios for budget cuts and the affect
            those cuts would have on the School of Social Welfare. </p>

          <p>The Accreditation series is composed primarily of reports created by the School of
            Social Welfare for use in the accreditation and reaccreditation processes. These reports
            include information on courses, faculty member curriculum vitae, data about the school,
            and self-study reports. Also included in the series are correspondence, memoranda, and
            other communications primarily directed to and from the current dean relating to the
            school’s accreditation process. Other materials include accreditation manuals and
            guidelines from the accrediting body, the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE).</p>

          <p>The bulk of the records consist of faculty meeting minutes and agendas from 1965-1996
            with a gap in records from 1972-1976. Also included are copies of minutes and agendas
            that are annotated by the current dean. Minutes and agendas include supporting documents
            used in the meetings, as well as correspondence and memoranda from the dean relating to
            issues raised in meetings or to be considered at future meetings. Other materials
            include yearly faculty activity reports that outline scholarship and service completed
            by faculty as well as materials related to summer faculty retreats including
            correspondence, planning documents, and materials generated at the retreat.</p>

          <p>Subject Files contain the day-to-day working files of the School of Social Welfare.
            Correspondence and memoranda, primarily from the dean at the time relating to various
            topics within the files, are interspersed throughout. Included among the materials are
            enrollment and admissions data, three and five year plans on the development and
            management of the school, publications, bulletins, commencement programs and speeches,
            grant proposals, committee membership and reports, and year-end reports from programs
            within the School of Social Welfare. Grant proposals include information relating to the
            proposed Social Work Research Development Center. School Bulletins range from 1965
            through 1979. Materials relating to the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) include
            statistical reports and the involvement of Lynn Videcka-Sherman as a board member on the
            council. Also included are scrapbook materials containing newspaper clippings,
            information on alumni and student achievements, and a few photos, primarily taken of
            faculty members. General files from the Continuing Education Program (CEP) are included
            within this series as well. Please note that not all dates are inclusive.</p>
