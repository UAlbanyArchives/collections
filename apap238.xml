      <p>Ernest Curto initially donated his papers to Syracuse University in 1965. In 2006, the
        papers were transferred to the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and
        Archives. </p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p> New York State Assemblyman Ernest Curto was born in Pentone, Italy on July 28, 1902. In
        1904, his family moved to Niagara Falls, New York, where he would later attend public
        schools. Curto attended the Genesee Wesleyan Preparatory Academy, and then studied at
        Niagara University and Syracuse University. He received his law degree from the University
        of Buffalo Law School, and became a member of the New York State Bar Association in 1935. </p>
      <p> Prior to his service in the New York State Assembly, Curto was employed as research
        counsel for Assemblyman Harry D. Suitor. He served two terms as the acting city and police
        court judge for the city of Niagara Falls. Curto was also active in various labor, religious
        (Catholic), and community organizations. </p>
      <p> Curto represented the Second District, which included Niagara County, in the New York
        State Assembly from 1946-1964. He was elected in a special election held November 6, 1945,
        following the death of Assemblyman Suitor. He was then re-elected in the general election of
        1946. During his almost two decades in the Assembly, he had a number of committee
        assignments, including: Codes, Rules, Public Service, Ethics and Guidance, and Canals and
        Waterways. He served as the chair of the Assembly Mortgage and Real Estate Committee. Curto
        also participated in several joint legislative committees, including: Commerce and Economic
        Development, Lake Erie-Lake Ontario Canal, and Housing and Urban Redevelopment. </p>
      <p> During his term in office, the New York State Power Authority, under the leadership of
        Robert Moses, constructed a massive power plant on the Niagara River. As a result of
        conflicts between the local governments in Niagara County and the Power Authority, Curto
        took a keen interest in local government matters, including taxes and land annexations.
        During the later part of his term, he became interested in urban renewal projects,
        especially in the city of Niagara Falls. Curto was also deeply concerned with labor issues,
        and he worked tirelessly for the passage of a bill in the Assembly that would ban the
        practice of employing professional strikebreakers. </p>
      <p>Following his retirement from the Assembly in 1965, Curto returned to his private law
        practice, where he continued to pursue his interest in local labor and urban renewal
        activities. He retired in 1992. On January 6, 1998, Ernest Curto passed away after a
        year-long illness. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor, and his three children. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Ernest Curto Papers span the years of 1944-1965, and are related to his career as a
        representative of Niagara County in the New York State Assembly. The papers include Assembly
        bills and supporting materials, correspondence, and subject files. These materials represent
        his legislative activities including legislative committee service, correspondence with
        constituents, organizations, and other legislators and government officials, and his
        sponsorship of legislation in the Assembly. The types of materials in the collection include
        letters, brochures, booklets, pamphlets, reports, memos, legislation, statistical data,
        resolutions, postcards, press clippings, press releases, speeches, hearing transcripts,
        notes, maps, charts, bound copies of bills, and field notes.</p>
      <p>Researchers should note that there is a small amount of material related to his
        post-legislative career in the collection that dates from 1965, but as it was related to
        earlier materials in the collection, the archivist chose to retain it.</p>
      <p>The series arrangement reflects the way that Curto and his staff organized and filed his
        papers. The archivist also elected to retain the folder titles created by Curto and his
        staff. The archivist chose to interfile materials that had been removed from their original
        folders prior to their arrival at the archives in existing series where appropriate and name
        them in a manner which corresponded to Curto's other folder names.</p>

          <p>This series contains the general subject files of Assemblyman Ernest Curto’s office,
            including: letters, memos, newsletters, press releases, newspaper clippings, pamphlets,
            transcripts, reports, informational booklets, notes, original legislation, resolutions,
            petitions, resolutions, speeches, statements, maps, and constituent correspondence. </p>
          <p>Researchers will find that a number of these subject files have to do with Curto’s
            Assembly committee work and legislation. Curto served as chairman of the Assembly
            Mortgage and Real Estate Committee, and as such, this series contains a large volume of
            materials from his involvement in public hearings in 1960 and 1961 that examined the
            mortgage lending practices of banks across New York State. These materials include
            hearing transcripts and committee correspondence, as well as hundreds of surveys
            returned to the committee from banks and other lending institutions.</p>
          <p>Curto also served on the Assembly Ethics and Guidance Committee that was organized in
            1961 to investigate corruption charges against then Assembly Speaker, Joseph Carlino. It
            was alleged that Carlino acted unethically by introducing a bill that would require all
            homeowners in New York State to build fallout shelters while serving as a paid board
            member of a company which built nuclear fallout shelters. The materials kept by Curto on
            this subject include hearing transcripts, correspondence, press releases, and newspaper
            clippings.</p>
          <p>Also, Curto collected a significant amount of material pertaining to the Power
            Authority of New York State’s work in constructing a power-generating facility on the
            Niagara River. Curto kept information related to federal hearings on the project, and
            correspondence with the Power Authority, Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, and the
            City of Niagara Falls. He also kept copies of monthly progress reports and annual
            reports published by the Power Authority, newspaper clippings, speeches, brochures, and
            other materials pertaining to the project. This material dates generally from the late
            1950s to the early 1960s. </p>
          <p>Another subject area on which Curto collected a large amount of information in the
            early 1960s was urban renewal. Researchers will find a number of reports and other
            statistical data produced by the State of New York, as well as correspondence, maps,
            memos, and other materials related to urban renewal and urban development projects.</p>
          <p>Researchers should note that this series contains information related to legislation
            that Curto introduced that banned the practice of hiring professional strikebreakers in
            New York State. Curto maintained information on this subject in the subject files and
            also in the bills series, so researchers interested in the subject should examine the
            materials held in both places.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>This series, divided into two subseries, contains legislation that for the most part
            was introduced by Assemblyman Ernest Curto, and supporting materials, including memos,
            correspondence regarding the bills, and newspaper clippings.</p>
          <p>The first subseries contains bound copies of the bills that Curto introduced. Each book
            contains bills from one session, and on the inside of the cover is a list of the bills
            contained in the book. Curto made notations on some of the covers, as well as on some of
            the bills, as to the fate of the legislation. Also in this subseries, researchers will
            find book covers that would have originally contained his personal bills, but arrived at
            the archives without their contents intact.</p>
          <p>The second subseries contains the files that Curto kept about each bill that he
            introduced in the New York State Assembly. He kept an individual file on each bill, and
            in some cases, more than one file if that bill had been amended significantly. The bill
            files contain copies of the legislation and, in some cases, notes, correspondence,
            newspaper clippings or memos related to the bill. The archivist elected to retain the
            original folder names used by Curto and his staff, and made copies of the original
            folders whenever Curto had made notations on them. </p>
          <p>Researchers should note that there are several bills in this subseries that were not
            introduced by Curto. There are several bills that Curto kept that relate to a special
            session of the legislature that was called by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the autumn
            of 1964, and the archivist elected to include them in this subseries.</p>
          <p>Researchers should be aware that the bills in this series relate to the latter half of
            Curto’s term in office. Earlier bills, those from 1948-1953, were in folders with
            correspondence. Since many of these bills are stamped “Compliments of Ernest Curto,” and
            not attached to other materials, the archivist elected to keep them in the
            correspondence series.</p>

          <p>This series, divided into two subseries, contains incoming and outgoing correspondence
            related to the legislative activities of Assemblyman Ernest Curto. Also in this series
            are enclosures that were included with the original correspondence including copies of
            legislation, resolutions, newspaper clippings, brochures, reports, and other
            materials.</p>
          <p>The constituent correspondence subseries is in the original order that Curto and his
            staff kept the files in. For this subseries, they chose to organize it by geographical
            location of the sender, and these locations corresponded to places in Curto’s Assembly
            District.</p>
          <p>As it was unclear how the general correspondence subseries was originally organized,
            the archivist arranged it chronologically. Researchers should note, as mentioned above,
            that this series contains bills from the earlier years of Curto’s service in the
            legislature. Bills from the later years are individually filed in the bills series.</p>
