    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>The Engaged Zen Foundation is an independent organization originally founded to foster zazen (seated contemplative meditation) practice in prisons. The experience of working in prisons throughout the United States over a dozen years has compelled the Engaged Zen Foundation's efforts to focus on the "complete circle of human rights imperatives." The Foundation is "committed to the abolition of punitive incarceration in any form, the dismantling of the prison industrial complex, and the adoption of alternative, restorative, methods of dealing with what is colloquially known as "criminal justice.'"</p>  </bioghist>
