    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Capital Jury Project was initiated in 1991 by a consortium of university-based researchers with support from the National Science Foundation. The Project was administered nationally by Dr. William Bowers, principal research scientist, Northeastern University. The findings of the CJP were based on 3 to 4 hour, in-depth, interviews with persons who have served as jurors in capital trials. </p><p>Phase I of the Project completed over 1,200 interviews from jurors in 353 capital trials in 14 states. These interviews chronicled the jurors' experiences and decision-making over the course of the trial, identifned points at which various influences come into play, and revealed the ways in which jurors reached their final sentencing decision. </p><p>The Project continued with the Capital Jury Project II (CJP2), a program of research on the decision-making of capital jurors. The second phase, CJP2 ran from 2001 to roughly 2005 when the third phase of the project started. The second phase was housed at the University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice's Capital Punishment Research Initiative, part of the Hindelang Criminal Justice Research Center. The main tenants of the research project were to (1) to build and maintain a national archive for historical documents and data on the death penalty; (2) to plan and conduct basic and policy related research on capital punishment; and (3) to encourage scholarship, conduct graduate and undergraduate training, and disseminate scientifically grounded knowledge about the ultimate penal sanction. </p><p>The principal investigator of the CJP was William J. Bowers (Ph.D., Columbia University, 1966). He was principal research scientist in the School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany, formerly of Northeastern University. For his research on capital punishment, in 2000 Dr. Bowers received the American Society of Criminology's August Vollmer Award for outstanding contributions in applied criminology.</p><p>Michael E. Antonio (Ph.D., Northeastern University, 2003) coordinated data management for the phase of the CJP on the role race plays in capital sentencing. Susan Ehrhard-Dietzel and Christopher E. Kelly (more recent doctoral recipients at the University at Albany and Temple University, respectively) assisted with the coordination and data management on the phase of the CJP concerned with jurors' receptivity to mitigation in capital sentencing.</p>  </bioghist>
