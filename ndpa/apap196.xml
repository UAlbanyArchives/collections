    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Capital Jury Project was initiated in 1991 by a consortium of university-based researchers with support from the National Science Foundation. The Project was administered nationally by Dr. William Bowers, principal research scientist, Northeastern University.</p><p>Phase I of the Project covered 353 capital trials in 14 states. The Project continued with the Capital Jury Project II (CJP2). The second phase, CJP2 ran from 2001 to roughly 2005 when the third phase of the project started. The second phase was housed at the University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice's Capital Punishment Research Initiative, part of the Hindelang Criminal Justice Research Center. The main tenants of the research project were to (1) to build and maintain a national archive for historical documents and data on the death penalty; (2) to plan and conduct basic and policy related research on capital punishment; and (3) to encourage scholarship, conduct graduate and undergraduate training, and disseminate scientifically grounded knowledge about the ultimate penal sanction. </p><p>The principal investigator of the Capital Jury Project was William J. Bowers (Ph.D., Columbia University, 1966). He was principal research scientist in the School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany, formerly of Northeastern University. For his research on capital punishment, in 2000 Dr. Bowers received the American Society of Criminology's August Vollmer Award for outstanding contributions in applied criminology.</p>  </bioghist>
