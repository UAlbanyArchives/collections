    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>New Yorkers for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (NYADP), founded in 1992 as New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty, was a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that in 2008 expanded its mission after achieving its primary objective of the effective abolition of capital punishment in New York. Led by executive director David Kaczynski, NYADP supports effective, rational, and humane approaches to the problem of violent crime in a post-death penalty environment. This collection documents both the organizations current and earlier mission.</p>  </bioghist>
