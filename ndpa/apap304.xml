    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty was founded in 1991 under the name of Virginians for Alternatives to State Killing by a group of 13 concerned citizens. In 1994 the group adopted the name, Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (VADP). The organization sought a moratorium on the death penalty in Virginia and continued to educate the public about inconsistencies in capital punishment for three decades.</p><p>The VADP rallied against the death penalty in a number of ways, including execution vigils, non-violent protests, and lobbying. The VADP held yearly conferences that individuals could attend. Membership in the VADP was open to anyone who wished to join and was not restricted to just Virginia citizens. </p><p>The VADP worked to educate the public and legislators about the ineffectiveness of the death penalty in Virginia and Virginia's 21 day rule, a policy which prohibited trial judges from reviewing newly discovered evidence if it was presented more than three weeks after a defendant's sentencing. 
 
On March 24, 2021, Virgina Governor Ralph Northam signed legislation abolishing the death penalty, making Virginia the 23rd state, and the first in South, to stop executions. Having built support among legislators to pass the bill, VADP achieved its 30-year objective of a moratorium on capital punishment in Virginia. Having reached this goal, knowing other allies would continue to safeguard the death penalty moratorium and waiting two years to ensure that the legislation was not quickly reinstated, the VADP board elected to close the organization in February 2024.</p>  </bioghist>
