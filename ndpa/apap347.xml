    <head>Biographical History</head>
Steven King Ainsworth, currently incarcerated in California, was sentenced to death in 1980 and served two decades on Death Row in San Quentin. In 2001 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California granted Ainsworth's habeas corpus petition vacating his capital sentence. Ainsworth is a published writer of fiction and non-fiction, and a self-taught artist whose work has been exhibited in the United States and internationally. His many publications include <emph render "italic">Words from the Row</emph> and essays or short stories in <emph render "italic">Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words</emph> (2001), <emph render "italic">Writing for Their Lives: Death Row U.S.A.</emph> (2007), and <emph render "italic">Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America</emph> (2014).  </bioghist>
