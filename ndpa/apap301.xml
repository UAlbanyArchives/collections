Watt Espy papers chronicle the extensive research efforts that led to the creation of the Capital Punishment Research Project and the database known as the Espy File. Espy spent three decades gathering and indexing documentation of legal executions in the United States. His papers contain both primary and secondary sources used to catalog thousands of instances of capital punishment in the United States and its territories since the 1600s. The collection includes material from corrections records, newspapers, county histories, legal proceedings, and books. In addition to the records pertaining specifically to the death penalty, there is also a selection of magazines collected by Espy that cover true crime stories as well as life in the American Old West.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>M. Watt Espy, Jr. (1933-2009) was widely recognized as one of the foremost historians of legal executions in the United States. Beginning with his own personal resources, in May 1970, Espy began the first serious quest to chronicle and document more than 15,000 government-sanctioned executions in the United States since 1608—an effort that formally became the Capital Punishment Research Project. His method was to collect information by obtaining state Department of Corrections records, newspapers, published and unpublished county histories, proceedings of state and local courts, magazines, and holdings of historical societies, libraries, museums, and archives.</p><p> Initially Espy accumulated and recorded information about executions in the United States from his home in Headland, Alabama as a part-time pursuit while working in sales. Between 1977 and 1985, however, the University of Alabama Law Center in Tuscaloosa hired Espy to continue his work and during this time he published "Capital Punishment and Deterrence: What the Statistics Cannot Show", <title><emph render="italic">Crime &amp; Delinquency</emph></title>, (Vol. 26, No. 4, 537-544 (1980). He also wrote numerous opinion editorials and histories of the death penalty for major daily newspapers, including the <title><emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph></title>, <title><emph render="italic"> The Atlanta Constitution</emph></title>, <title><emph render="italic">The Virginian-Pilot</emph></title>, <title><emph render="italic">The Columbus Dispatch</emph></title>, the <title><emph render="italic">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</emph></title>, and <title><emph render="italic">The Nashville Tennessean</emph></title>, throughout the 1980s. In 1984, the National Science Foundation awarded a grant to support the preparation of a comprehensive computer database with Espy's exhaustive research as its foundation.</p><p> In 1987, that database became a reality when the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) published a dataset, <title><emph render="italic">Executions in the United States, 1608-1987: The Espy File</emph></title> (ICPSR 51). The portable data file furnishes information on executions performed under civil authority in the United States between 1608 and July 6, 1987, and describes each individual executed and the circumstances surrounding the crime for which the person was convicted. Variables include age, race, name, occupation, and sex of the individual; date, jurisdiction, place, and method of execution; and the crime committed. Also recorded is whether the only evidence for the execution was official records indicating that an executioner or slave owner received compensated for an execution. The Espy File was subsequently updated to include executions through 2002.</p><p> The Espy File is based on several ledgers that Espy used to confirm an execution. In one ledger, he arranged executions alphabetically by state and then in chronological order. Espy recorded the name, race, age and occupation of the offender, county of conviction, crime, date and method of execution. A second ledger contained the same cases listed chronologically, beginning with 1608. Espy included just the name of the individual, the crime, and date, location, and method of execution. A third, and much smaller ledger, also is arranged by year and contains post-Furman executions beginning in 1986. There is also a page for new confirmations from nineteenth and earlier twentieth century dates.</p><p> Espy's work went beyond simply tallying the total number of executions. Instead he passionately researched and gathered all available background information on those executed, writing detailed note cards, narratives, and the ledger entries, which are all included in the collection. He painstakingly sought confirmation that officials carried out even the most obscure death sentences. Espy innovatively utilized antebellum state and county warrant records outlining compensation for executed slaves in his research. He explored the lesser known area of juvenile executions, documenting cases where children and teenagers received death sentences. Espy chronicled gruesome capital punishments for participants in slave rebellions during the colonial period. In addition, he uncovered botched executions where law enforcement hanged or electrocuted the same man more than once to complete the death sentence. As a further indication of his all-consuming interest in researching capital punishment, Espy filled the walls of his home with photographs of individuals executed.</p><p> Although he attended the University of Alabama for two years following service in the United States Navy during the Korean War, Espy never received a college degree. However, through his work, he earned the respect and admiration of academics, advocacy groups, and members of the general public. In 1991 the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty honored Espy with a special award at its annual meeting. His professional relationships with noted death penalty abolitionists, sociologists, criminal justice professors, authors, lawyers, members of Congress, and advocacy group executives are detailed in his correspondence. This group includes such notables as former director of the American Civil Liberties Union Capital Punishment Project <persname>Henry Scharwzchild</persname> and leading experts on capital punishment Dr. <persname>Hugo Bedau,</persname> and Dr. <persname>Michael Radelet</persname>, who once commented that "'[Espy] is widely recognized by everyone in the academic world as America's foremost death penalty historian." (Ronald Smothers, "Headland Journal; Historian's Death Penalty Obsession," The New York Times, October 21, 1987.) Letters describe how public defender offices and defense attorneys hired Espy to research past crimes and executions as part of mounting a defense in capital cases. Prisoners exchanged correspondence with him for insights gleaned from his work and moral support. (Series 5: Correspondence).</p><p> Following his affiliation with the University of Alabama Law Center, Espy continued to research and document executions, write, consult, and lecture from his home base in Headland until his death in August 2009.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The M. Watt Espy Papers document more than three decades of research from the nationally recognized expert on legal executions in the United States. Beginning as a macabre hobby in 1970, M. Watt Espy, Jr. began chronicling tens of thousands of government-sanctioned capital punishment sentences from the colonial period until the present day. His solitary hobby eventually became an all-consuming passion and he embarked upon a full-time career as the commanding force behind the Capital Punishment Research Project.</p><p> In 1987, <title><emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph></title> profiled Espy, his work and his "death penalty obsession" stating: "By all accounts Watt Espy's collection is as unique as he is eccentric." This statement remains an accurate description of Espy's materials and the death penalty researcher himself. The collection includes Espy's vast documentation of executions in America, including a series of typed index cards listing individuals executed. Espy's method was to collect information by obtaining state Department of Corrections records, newspaper articles, published and unpublished county histories, proceedings of state and local courts, magazines, and holdings of historical societies, libraries, museums, and archives. In addition, there is aggregated research data, administrative files, general subject research and notes, professional correspondence, news articles about or citing Espy, statements to the media, copies of his published and unpublished writings (including numerous opinion editorials), texts of speeches and testimonials before government panels, a personal signed portrait and autograph collection, scholarly works by others writing in the fields of history, crime, capital punishment, and the legal system, materials from advocacy organizations, photographs of individuals executed, and true crime, penitentiary, and general interest publications and books. Although the materials in the collection include eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth century dates of creation, please note many of these items are photocopies of originals.</p><p> The collection also documents Espy's research and thought process over the course of more than three decades. Espy's materials illustrate the shift of research methodologies of the 1970s and 1980s through the twenty-first century. While he began by spending countless hours typing up correspondence to libraries, archives and historical societies, and scouring microfilm, the later portions of the collection include e-mail correspondence and news articles culled from the Internet. Of note, Espy rejected his earlier beliefs favoring capital punishment and over time became a critic of executions, arguing they did not deter future criminal acts and objecting to the number of individuals executed who were not guilty.</p>  </scopecontent>

The index card files are arranged alphabetically by state, then alphabetically by person's name within each state. Documentation of executions are arranged in subseries based on Espy's own categorization: the 50 states/District of Columbia/territories, federal, military, Native American tribal, and international. Correspondence is subdivided into regular communication/people of prominence and general communication, then is alphabetical within those two groups. Publications are alphabetical by title, then chronological within each title.</p>  </arrangement>

Some cards contain lots of information, including name, place of execution, method, and details of the crime. Other cards have very little information aside from the fact that someone was executed. Sometimes there is not even a name—just "two slaves" or "pirate". There are additional categories for federal, military, and Indian tribal executions. There are two different card sizes; for the 3x5 inch cards, each state, territory, or other main division is identified with a manila tab. Subdivisions are marked with blue, unlined cards and are intended to mirror the arrangement of materials in Series #2 as closely as possible.</p><p> In addition to Espy's numerous 3x5 inch cards, there is also an assortment of 4x6 inch cards used in cases where Espy continued information for prisoners who had lengthy and/or unusual details regarding their crimes and punishments. Nearly every state is featured in this category, as well as Guam, Indian tribal, military, and federal executions. Since Espy did not have surplus information to match every 3x5 card, the 4x6 cards are a much smaller group. Researchers will know when to refer to the larger index cards because Espy noted "see large card" on the 3x5 size where appropriate. The 4x6 cards do not have any subdivisions and are arranged alphabetically by state, then alphabetically by prisoner name within each state.</p><p> Special notes for 3x5 index cards:</p><p> 1. Slave states of the South, as well as colonial states of the North, usually have an extra category of cards: compensation paid to owners whose slaves were executed for crimes. Espy was the first researcher to track that information. However, cards showing compensation paid to sheriffs for carrying out executions are not separated into their own group.</p><p> 2. Espy marked certain cards "unconfirmed" if he did not have sufficient evidence that an execution was carried out. Other cards indicate that an individual (or individuals) received a death sentence, but there is neither an "unconfirmed" notation nor date of death. Those cards have been categorized by the archivist as additional unconfirmed executions.</p><p> 3. Researchers might want to search more than one category within a state, because some executions fit more than one description. Ex. "Female slave" executed 1858 whose owner was paid $400 would fit the categories of anonymous executions and slave owner compensations, but would only be filed in the latter. Ex. #2: "Man and Woman" possibly hanged in Kentucky, 1820s—would be filed in unconfirmed executions, not the anonymous group.</p><p> 4. Card files include military executions and lynchings although neither were a main focus of Espy's research.</p><p> 5. Cards that name 3 or more individuals executed are in order by whoever's name would properly be first alphabetically, even if Espy did not list that person's name first. Ex: Dennis Igoe, James Johnson, and Joseph Frampton- Frampton is first alphabetically and is filed as such although his name is listed last on Espy's index card.</p><p> 6. Many of the 3x5 card subdivisions identified by blue cards are organized alphabetically, but due to time constraints, the slave owner compensation categories are not alphabetized.</p></scopecontent><c

id="aspace_7844f08134d1f633893d4921e724cfd7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series comprises the bulk of Watt Espy's primary and secondary research and is therefore the largest in the collection. Initially, approximately half of these documentation of execution records were arranged in an organized fashion alphabetically by state, or by federal, military, tribal or international categories and then alphabetically by an individual's name. The others were not arranged in any discernable scheme with a significant amount of materials kept as unorganized loose documents in boxes. Espy marked some files as "not written up," but it was ultimately unclear how these differed from other records. After careful review, the archivists decided to combine all of the documentation of executions together, divided the records into five subseries for executions conducted by all 50 states and the District of Columbia, federal executions, military executions, Native American tribal executions, and international executions, and subsequently arranged and inter-filed all the loose materials.</p><p> This series consists of state Department of Corrections records, newspapers, published and unpublished state and county histories, proceedings of state and local courts, magazines, holdings of historical societies, libraries, museums, and archives, notes taken by Espy or others conducting research, lists of individuals executed by state or county, annotated photocopies of Espy's index card files, and documentation of executions sent via correspondence. The amount of material varies greatly by individual. Individuals are referred to by last name or, in the absence of a surname, by their given name. In general, date ranges for this series are not inclusive. Although the folders include eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth century dates of creation, please note many of these items are photocopies of originals that Espy utilized for his research.</p><p> In addition, Espy frequently grouped together materials for individuals executed for the same crime or executed on the same day for different crimes. Therefore he often had only one set of records for two people executed for the same crime. The archivists filed these records under the name of the individual whose last name or given name was alphabetically first.</p><p> The respective volumes of aggregated material suggest Espy focused heavily on U.S. state and federal executions, and not military, tribal or international ones. The state subseries is the largest of the five and documents executions in the United States by state or in the District of Columbia. It also includes executions in colonies or territories that later became states. The files are arranged alphabetically by state and then alphabetically by the last name of the individual executed when one or two people received the death penalty. Next are files containing references to multiple executions, three or more individuals executed on the same day or for conviction of the same crime; anonymous individuals executed, such as a "slave woman" or "pirate man;" city, county, state, or regional records and histories, and lists of individuals executed; and unconfirmed or possible executions. At the end of this subseries are files with lists or records of individuals executed from multiple states. For instance, a list of juveniles or innocents executed from more than one state or executions from other states listed in Maryland newspapers.</p><p> The federal, military and Native American tribal subseries follow the same arrangement scheme. The files are organized alphabetically by the last name of the individual executed when one or two people received the death penalty. Following are files containing references to multiple executions, lists of individuals executed, and then unconfirmed executions.</p><p> The international subseries is arranged alphabetically by country and then by an individual's last name. There are less than fifteen countries and one U.S. territory mentioned.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f4995ebe46e069b7db679188bf7824a5"

Contents</head><p>This series features administrative records of Watt Espy's efforts to chronicle every government-sanctioned execution in the United States as part of his Capital Punishment Research Project. Espy was the only full-time employee of this organization although he worked with paid graduate assistants while at the University of Alabama School of Law.</p><p> Through correspondence, this series recounts Espy's work at the university, including the tribulations of his work on the National Science Foundation grant to produce a dataset of executions in the United States and relations with his academic partner on the grant. Espy writes often of his difficulties with the dataset, outlining errors committed by others during the data entry process, such as using the wrong code for type of execution, misspelling prisoner names, and typing in incorrect dates. There are numerous computer printouts of the dataset.</p><p> The series also contains Espy's work from his home in Headland. There are his hard-copy and handwritten ledgers listing the executions he researched and their particulars. Files document administrative activities, including issuing invoices, paying bills, and submitting a copyright registration request. Date books from 1986-1990 and 1995 describe research requests, appointments, talks, meetings and telephone conversations.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_1738c73deeefa4e757e64906545176ae"

id="aspace_bf06c00ac8f31c99699817e4c0318014"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Watt Espy subject files contain a variety of materials that supplement information in the other series without necessarily being directly related. Researchers will find background information on the history of capital punishment, death penalty statistics, and a few files on crime in general. There are folders devoted to crime and punishment in many individual states and territories, though not all of them are represented. The subject files also contain information on the various methods of execution employed across the country, mainly hanging, gassing, electrocution, and lethal injection. Additionally, there are death penalty-related topics such as physician participation, editorial pieces dealing with ethics of capital punishment, execution of prisoners with low IQs, background materials on the death penalty in early America, and a few assorted death penalty research projects that Espy followed. There are also assorted photos, many of which feature inmates and prisons. Images of identified and unidentified individuals executed are presumed to be the ones that filled the walls of Espy's house.</p><p> The subject files mainly are comprised of secondary source materials collected by Espy by virtue of his interest in the topics or actively used by him in his research. Occasionally there are entire photocopied books, or chapters of books, which have been retained due to the age and/or scarcity of the originals from which they were taken. </p><p> Many folders have items dated in the 1950s and earlier, some even to the 1800s, but those dates reflect the age of the content, not the documents themselves. Most of the papers in the subject files are photocopies obtained by Espy from the 1970s to the 1990s. Also, please note that the date spans in this series are not inclusive.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_c07d16ad86b2ca15d994c400a7db25a6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agresti, David-- Research

id="aspace_a6f8357eb0a9fd56bf86d7c7938c0ea0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Watt Espy sent and received a significant amount of correspondence as part of his work on the Capital Punishment Research Project. The majority of correspondence, however, was not organized when it arrived at the University at Albany. The archivists elected to arrange it into two groups: files devoted to prominent or regular correspondents, and general correspondence. The former includes key academics (Michael Radelet, Hugo Bedeau, Margaret Vandiver), attorneys (The California Appellate Project, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Ohio Public Defender's Office), death penalty abolitionists and advocacy group executives (Rev. Joe Ingle, Sister Helen Prejean, Henry Schwarzschild), prominent prisoners and their families (Kerry Max Cook, Gary McGivern), and researchers who frequently corresponded with Espy. There were also a small number of files that Espy organized by subject, such as letters to and from prisoners, telephone inquiries, or correspondence relating to executions in a particular state, and the archivists retained this order and kept the files in the first group. The second group includes more infrequent correspondents, usually general inquiries sent to libraries or archives for records relating to individuals executed or for research requests.</p><p> Please see Series 3: Capital Punishment Research Project for correspondence specifically relating to Espy's work at the University of Alabama School of Law and the National Science Foundation grant and Series 6: Biographical Materials for correspondence related to some of Espy's publications, testimony, speaking events, and signed portrait and autograph collection.</p></scopecontent><c

prison conditions, for human rights, and for an improved and unbiased criminal justice system. The groups vary and may be secular or religious, national, statewide or local. Materials in this series include newsletters, execution alerts, appeals, meeting minutes, and brochures. In some instances, it is possible to determine that Espy was active within or supported a particular organization as his name appears in meeting minutes or related papers.</p></scopecontent><c

western U.S. life and culture, and legal publications containing articles about capital crimes, executions, and criminal profiles. The publications date from the 1930s into the 21st Century. While some present straightforward non-fiction explanations of crimes, others feature more sensational accounts with lurid depictions. Of interest are 30 issues of the award-winning <title><emph render="italic">The Angolite</emph></title>, a newsmagazine written by prisoners at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. This series also includes more than a half dozen Death Row annuals, featuring profiles and photographs of condemned prisoners, and a set of serial killer, mass murderer and gangster trading cards. Please note that Espy personally bound the publications in boxes 88-90, but did not include all issues for each year in the bound volume. Therefore some publications have both bound and unbound issues.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_892a8dd3b018b36f6b7e2cddcf6eaaba" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">ABA
