    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Marie McFadden Deans (1940-2011) was a death penalty abolitionist and an advocate for individuals on death row.  Following the murder of her mother-in-law Penny Deans in 1972, Marie Deans began to voice her opposition to capital punishment.  In 1976, Marie Deans formed Murder Victims' Families Against the Death Penalty (later called Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation) and, in 1983, established the Virginia Coalition on Jails and Prisons.  Deans worked on legal cases â€“ those of individuals already on death row and individuals on trial for capital crimes, hoping to mitigate their sentences.   She visited inmates on the death row, and was present at the executions of almost three dozen individuals in Virginia and South Carolina.  </p><p>Although the Virginia Coalition on Jails and Prisons closed after a decade of existence, Marie Deans continued to investigate cases, find inmates attorneys, petition for clemency, call for the abolishment of the death penalty, and advocate for prisoners until her death from lung cancer.</p>  </bioghist>
