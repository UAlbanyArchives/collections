    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>For over six decades, Eugene G. Wanger has collected or created thousands of items about capital punishment that comprise the Eugene G. Wanger and Marilyn M. Wanger Death Penalty Collection, which before being placed with the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives was considered the largest private collection on the subject in the United States. The collection concentrates on the death penalty's history, operation, psychological impact, compatibility with religious and moral values, and efforts to abolish or restore it.</p>

<p>The collection's thousands of books and pamphlets have been digitized by HeinOnline, a subscription-based online research platform, for worldwide distribution, hundreds of them being from the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p>The collection also contains hundreds of files on almost every aspect of capital punishment, many rare or unique audio and video recordings, dozens of original death penalty abolitionist posters, and artifacts pertaining to capital punishment.</p>  

<p>To assist researchers, a published bibliography of the collection, extensively annotated by Mr. Wanger, containing box and folder inventories, is available in the department and at many libraries.</p>  </scopecontent>
