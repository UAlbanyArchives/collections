      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>The Faculty-Student Association (FSA) developed in 1950 at the New York State College for
        Teachers. This non-profit corporation operated and financed ancillary enterprises associated
        with higher education, such as the bookstore and dining services. The college’s co-op
        bookstore began in the 1920s, but effective September 1, 1950 the FSA assumed its assets,
        liabilities and ownership. Similarly the College cafeteria opened in the early 1940s and in
        1951, the FSA assumed the assets, liabilities and ownership of the cafeteria.</p>
      <p>FSA diversified into new areas beyond the book store and dining services during the next
        two decades. This included check cashing, operation of a barber shop and beauty parlor, real
        estate investment, management of the College bowling alley, provision of linen and dry
        cleaning services, loans, film service and supervision of scholarship endowments. With a
        high demand for housing, the FSA in the early 1950s began to acquire area single-family
        homes and apartments by lease or purchase to provide homes for faculty and students. The FSA
        sold these homes during the 1970s. In 1965 the FSA purchased the Mohawk Campus, several
        parcels of land along the Mohawk River near the Northway, and Goodman Place, adjacent to the
        University's recreational facility Camp Dippikill, in 1966. Both were later sold as
        well.</p>
      <p>The organization employed nearly 200 full-time staff members as of 1967 and 275 by 1972.
        Hundreds of students also filled temporary positions with the organization. An executive
        director (later a general manager) oversaw the day-to-day operations of the FSA. A Board of
        Directors provided policy direction for the FSA and had representatives from administration,
        faculty and students.</p>
      <p>In 1966, New York State required FSA to begin to enter into formal, yearly contracts for
        services with the State University of New York Central Office. Two of these contracts are
        included in the records.</p>
      <p>During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the FSA experienced a cash shortage and students
        began to demand control over the FSA budget, specifically its allocation of funds. The <emph render="italic">Albany Student Press</emph> published a series of investigative reports on
        the FSA during the fall of 1971 seeking to provide students with a better understanding of
        the association and its holdings. This demand for reform resulted in greater student
        representation on the Board of Directors, elimination of free meals for dorm directors,
        resident assistants and international students and allowing student input on the hiring of
        key FSA personnel. In 1975 students took even greater control of the Board and its
        leadership. In addition to the divesting of real estate, there were other financial
        restructuring changes, especially the contracting of bookstore operations in 1972 to a
        private vendor who paid the FSA a percentage of gross sales.</p>
      <p>In 1976, prompted by its student members, the FSA changed its name to University Auxiliary
        Services (UAS) to avoid confusion with other groups with the words student association in
        their names. The UAS continued to invest in and provide campus services (often through
        corporate partners) such as dining, vending, banking and the bookstore. This non-profit
        corporation remains part of the University community today.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Faculty-Student Association (FSA) Records document the administrative and financial
        operations of this non-profit organization which provided ancillary services to the campus
        community. The majority of records are from the 1960s and 1970s. There is a smaller
        percentage of files from the 1950s, but none from the organization's founding in 1950. In
        1976 the organization changed its name to University Auxiliary Services and there is a small
        number of materials from 1976 reflecting this transition. </p>
      <p>The records consist of financial reports, audits, by-laws, correspondence, studies and
        meeting minutes. There also are some brochures and background materials on the FSA.</p>
      <p>The archivist retained the original order and folder titles.</p>
