      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>In the spring of 1966 Evan R. Collins, president of SUNYA, and Eugene Rabinowitch began a dialogue in which it was proposed that Rabinowitch come to SUNYA and help establish a research center which would be concerned with the impact of science and technology on public policy. In April 1967 the Educational Policies Council of the University Senate approved the creation of such a center, and an ad hoc planning committee was appointed. Throughout 1967 Rabinowitch working in conjunction with Eugene McLaren, assistant Dean of the Division of Science and Mathematics, organized the center and mapped out the future program and goals of the center. </p>
      <p>By 1968 the Center for Science and the Future of Human Affairs was a reality. The Center was "organized for the purpose of orderly study of the interactions of modern science, its products and services, with the activities and aims of humankind." The Center was to develop "interdisciplinary research programs dealing with the impact of science and technology on man's personal and social existence" and considers "new approaches to education for life in the scientific age." </p>
      <p>During 1967 and early 1968, Eugene Rabinowitch had presented a series of lectures at SUNYA. In September 1968 he was appointed as a professor of biology and chemistry at SUNYA with the additional duty of being senior advisor to the new Center. </p>
      <p>On July 1, 1968 Victor Rabinowitch, son of Eugene Rabinowitch, was hired as director of the Center. Serving at the pleasure of SUNYA's president, Victor Rabinowitch was to be "senior administrator and manager of the operations of the Center." The director was assisted by an Advisory Committee drawn from the faculty of SUNYA. </p>
      <p>The Center received a small planning grant from the Fleischmann Foundation in 1968. In 1969 another grant was received from the National Science Foundation; however, the Center never received sufficient support or funding from the state legislature, SUNY's central administration, or the SUNYA community. </p>
      <p>In August 1969 the Center changed its name to the Center for the Study of Science and Society. </p>
      <p>During its existence the Center did conduct at least four conferences. They include: The Scientific Revolution--Its Impact on Man and Society, March 1968; Evolutionary Processes, April 1970; The Integration of Science into General Education, May 1970; and, The Steady State Society, July 1971. </p>
      <p>Frustrated by lack of support for the Center, Victor Rabinowitch, resigned as director on February 27, 1970. From March 1 to September 1, 1970 Eugene Rabinowitch was interim director of the Center. Heinz G. Pfeiffer was appointed director of the Center in April 1971, but by June 1971 he was no longer on the University payroll. The exact date that the Center ceased operations is unclear; however, this certainly happened by the time Eugene Rabinowitch left SUNYA in August 1972. The Center was finally a victim of the budget cuts and retrenchment which SUNYA underwent in the early 1970s. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Center for the Study of Science and Society, 1966-1972, files contain the papers of Eugene Rabinowitch, Victor Rabinowitch, and Eugene H. McLaren. The files consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence, memoranda, reports, budgets, and financial statements, grant proposals, conference programs and papers, participant lists, resumes, press releases, reprints, pamphlets, leaflets, and clippings. </p>
      <p>The files detail the history, structure, and activities of the Center. There are files relating to grants, which funded the Center. There are also files detailing the Center's relationship with other offices and departments on the SUNYA campus, as well as with SUNY Central Administration and the New York legislature. Several files detail the conferences and symposia sponsored by the Center. In addition, there are files containing materials from or about similar public policy programs at other institutions. </p>

      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
      <p>The files are arranged alphabetically by name of individual, name of organization, or subject. A general file for each letter of the alphabet precedes files for the same letter of the alphabet (ie.: "A" precedes "Advisory Committee"). Material within the files is arranged chronologically by year, month, and day. Partially dated material is placed at the end of the month or year; undated items are placed after dated materials. Enclosures are placed after their letter of transmittal.</p>
