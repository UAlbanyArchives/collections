      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Society for the Preservation of Water Resources, Inc. (SPWR), was incorporated on June 24, 1981 as the Society for the Preservation of the Aquifer, a not-for-profit corporation "to promote the protection of Schenectady County water resources; to encourage citizen participation in the decision making process affecting water resources; to educate the community on issues having direct or implied consequences for county water resources; to spearhead activities designed to protect the County's water resources from compromise; and to raise funds". The members of the association were mostly engineers and scientists, people with the technical background to understand the problems they were addressing.</p>
      <p>The administrative structure of the association was simple: a president, a vice-president and a secretary/treasurer. The members met periodically to discuss their concerns and to plan their strategy. They encouraged the public to take an interest in preserving their water resources and they worked together with others to try to reach their goals.</p>
      <p>As preserving the purity of the Great Flats Aquifer of Schenectady County was their major concern, the Society for the Preservation of the Aquifer was also known as SPA, an acronym that people could remember. One of the organization's major projects was to prevent Wilmorite, Inc., from building Rotterdam Square Mall (which at one point was being called Westview Mall) over the aquifer. The society came up with alternate sites for the mall, including the site for Broadway Mall, a mall proposed but never built for downtown Schenectady. The group was interested in other possible threats to the aquifer, including the town of Rotterdam's proposed outfall sewer line over the aquifer and the leaking of gas from a Mobil gas station near a critical area of the aquifer. The group also followed the course of the water supply applications that the city of Schenectady and the town of Rotterdam submitted to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The water supply applications were apparent attempts to gain control over and, therefore, protect critical areas of the aquifer. SPWR also worked to keep Bonded Concrete from mining gravel from the aquifer and tried to stop other projects such as the Guildercrest development and the Schermerhorn Hollow Village complex that interfered with the Schenectady County aquifer [Kagay, John, telephone conversation, 24 October 1988].</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The bulk of the records of the Society for the Preservation of Water Resources consist of files on the major projects the society undertook, such as the Wilmorite project, the Bonded Concrete project, and the water supply applications of the city of Schenectady and the town of Rotterdam (1982-1985). As most of these projects concerned legal questions, the files consist primarily of legal papers not produced by SPWR, but many include notes by SPWR. The records for each of these projects form a complete record of the legal proceedings for each project including testimony by expert witnesses for SPWR. However, little information about the SPWR's strategies can be gleaned from this material. For instance, the records provide little evidence that the society was interested in the Broadway Mall project (1960, 1980-1981) because they thought the site for the Broadway Mall might be a possible alternate site for Wilmorite's Rotterdam Square Mall.</p>
      <p>The news clippings (1978-1992) appear to be complete and these contain some general clippings on water problems as well as much information about the history of the projects that the society worked on, but not necessarily from the point of view of SPWR. These clippings do have some information on entire projects that are not easy to find elsewhere in the records. One instance of this might be the SPWR project that concerned gasoline leaking from a service station over the aquifer. This was a very small project that required no legal moves, and therefore there is no separate series on this project. The news clippings series is probably the best place to find this information. Even the meeting minutes (1981-1987) and the day file (1981-1985) would be little help, because these generally contain little more than sketchy notes and most of them are difficult to read because they are handwritten.</p>
      <p>The large maps and photographs (1975, 1978-1981) are often useful to help a researcher visualize where the controversies took place. There is little material in the general files (1981-1985, 1988, 1991), but it does give a broad idea of the goals and the strategies of the Society for the Preservation of Water Resources. Overall, these records greatly favor information from the Wilmorite Project, which makes up nearly half of the available content.</p>
      <p>This collection was donated to the University Libraries in two separate accessions 17 yars apart. The first donation consisted of 7 cubic feet of material, while the second donation was over 5 cubic feet of material. Because the first donation of material had already been processed before the arrival of the remaining material, consideration had to be made on how to combine the records. The newer accessioned material was for the most part added to the ends of existing series, so researchers will note that there are separate alphabetic arrangements within series 4, 6, and 8. The records processed in 1988 were not altered, which also explains why series 4, 6, and 8 are not housed in sequentially numbered boxes.</p>

          <p>Records concerning the Society for the Preservation of Water Resources' project to keep Wilmorite, Inc., from building Rotterdam Square Mall over the Great Falls Aquifer. Includes hearing transcripts, intervention papers, petitions, environmental and other studies, draft environmental impact statements (DEIS), briefs, reply briefs, statements of concern, and other papers dealing with this project. A related series is the "Broadway Mall Project" which interested SPWR because the site for that proposed mall might have been an alternate site for Wilmorite's mall. Also related to this series is the water supply applications, which contains records of attempts by the city of Schenectady and the town of Rotterdam to buy land over the aquifer in order to protect their water supply.</p>
          <p>The material in this series was acquired in two separate accessions several years apart and the arrangement of the series reflects this. The records accessioned in 1988 can be found in boxes 2-4 and are in alphabetical order. The records accessioned in 2005 can be found in boxes 7-10. This material is arranged by topic, with most of the individual topics being arranged in alphabetical order. Boxes 7A and 9A contain folders with legal size material.</p>
