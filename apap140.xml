      <p>Henry M. Madej began donating his papers to the M.E. Grenander Department of Special
        Collections in 2002, and has continued to make subsequent donations. </p>

      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Henry Madej, an alumnus of the University at Albany, received his bachelor of arts degree
        in 1967 and his master of public administration degree in 1969. An inductee to the Alpha Phi
        Gamma Journalism Fraternity and a supporter of the University at Albany campus community,
        Madej was recognized in 1986 for fifteen years of service to the University Alumni Council.
        Madej served as deputy director, New York State Assembly Research Service, and later as
        legislative director for a New York State Assemblyperson.</p>
      <p> A long-time Albany resident, Madej has been extremely active in the city's Pine Hills
        Neighborhood Association, serving a term as president of the organization. The Pine Hills
        Neighborhood Association covers the neighborhood adjacent to the University at Albany's
        Downtown Campus and is a mix of student housing, long-term residents, and commercial areas. </p>
      <p> Because of his involvement with the Pine Hills Neighborhood Association, Madej became 
        involved with planning Albany's Tricentennial celebration and was the Pine Hills representative 
        to the Tricentennial Commission. As Pine Hills representative, Madej helped decide which
        banners that would be used in his neighboorhood and where they would be placed. In addition, Madej also assisted with
        scheduling events that would take place throughout the year for the Tricentennial.</p>
      <p> Madej was also involved with other citywide initiatives and organizations. He served on the Albany City Charter
        Revision Commission in the late 1990s, an organization which sought to update the 300 year
        old Albany city charter so that it reflected an effective municipal government for the new
        millennium. As described by Revision Commission member Mary Ellen O’Connor in a 1997 <emph render="italic">Times Union</emph> article, the impetus of the Commission was to “revise
        rather that rewrite Albany's charter in order to maintain our historic status as having the
        oldest city charter in the United States. We want to present a clear and concise legal
        directive for those who administer our city government.” Greatly dedicated to improving
        Albany, Madej has participated on various other local boards and committees, including a
        review panel established by Mayor Gerald D. Jennings in 2001 to deliberate on parking
        problems in the Pine Hills neighborhood. </p>
      <p> The information provided above was gleaned from the following sources, in addition to
          those found in the Henry M. Madej Papers themselves: <list type="simple"><item>"Albany's Historic Charter Overdue for Modernization,"<emph render="italic"> Times
                Union,</emph> 20 July 1997, sec. PERSPECTIVE, B1</item><item>"Review Panel Established,"<emph render="italic"> Times Union,</emph> 16 February

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Henry M. Madej Papers primarily document his community involvement with the Albany City 
        Charter Revision Commission and the Pine Hills Neighborhood Association during the 1990s and 
        2000s. Along with these items, the collection also includes documents showing Madej’s involvement
        in  planning Albany’s Tricentennial celebration. The items concerning the Tricentennial date from 
        1983 to 1987 with the majority focusing on 1986. There are no materials covering 1984. The collection 
        is comprised of professional correspondence, meeting minutes and agendas, addresses made to public 
        hearings, newsletters, document drafts, organizational by laws, sample charters from other cities in 
        New York State, notes, event schedules, event invitations,event plans, and pamphlets. In addition, 
        the collection contains newspaper clippings, magazines and editorials related to Madej's work with 
        these organizations. The collection also includes four cloth banners from the Pine Hills Neighborhood
        Association, two Frisbees from Albany’s Tricentennial, an Albany Tricentennial Neighborhood Olympics Medal,
        and photographs and certificates associated with Madej's University at Albany alumni activities.
