      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>Sigma Pi Phi, Beta Psi Boulé is the Capital District’s chapter of the nation’s oldest
        Greek-letter organization comprised of college-educated and professional African American
        men. Founded in Philadelphia on May 15, 1904, the Sigma Pi Phi fraternity is referred to as
        the Boulé which is Greek for a council of noblemen. Its members are called Archons and their
        wives are Archousia. As of 2012, Sigma Pi Phi had over 5,000 members in 129 "chapters",
        known as member Boulés, throughout the United States, the United Kingdom and the Bahamas. A
        secret society, Sigma Pi Phi has begun to release information about itself to the public,
        however, it still holds to confidentiality within the organization. </p>
      <p>The national office is the Grand Boulé with five regional Boulés to represent the
        Northeast, Southeast, Central, Western, and Pacific regions with individual Boulés within
        each. Sigma Pi Phi’s elected executive officers are referred to by Greek titles. The local
        Boulé head is the Sire Archon, and there is a Sire Archon-Elect, and an Immediate Past Sire
        Archon. The Grammateus is the executive secretary, the Thesauristes is the treasurer, the
        Rhetoricus arranges meetings and programs, the Agogos heads the constitution and by-laws
        committee and the Grapter is the official news reporter of the Boulé in charge of news and
        editorial duties. The Grand Boulé's elected executive officers are Grand Officers with the
        title Grand before their post and the regional Boulés' elected executive officers have the
        respective Region added before the position title. For example, Northeast Region Sire Archon
        would be the head of the Northeast Region. </p>
      <p> The Beta Psi Boulé of the Capital Region was established on May 5, 1984. It has been
        active in and supportive of the Capital District community for more than a quarter century
        hosting annual community events, supporting charitable initiatives for various causes and
        sponsoring endowments directly from Beta Psi or from the Sigma Pi Phi Foundation. The
        University at Albany Spellman Achievement Award is a Beta Psi scholarship endowment created
        in honor of the late Seth Spellman Jr., one of the founders of the Beta Psi Boulé. The
        members of Beta Psi are high ranking officials in the Capital District community, including
        faculty and administrators in area Universities, business owners and other professionals
        with postgraduate educations and titles. </p>
      <p>The current Sire Archon of Beta Psi Boulé is Dr. Levester Cannon. Former Sire Archons
        include:</p>

          <p>This series contains the Beta Psi Boulé’s administrative records. The materials cover
            the beginning of the charter process for the Beta Psi Boulé to present day. The files
            consist of the Boulé’s day-to-day administrative records for 1984-2015 with the
            exception of the years 1991 and 2010. The series consists of charter plans, certificates
            and reports, administrative records, Beta Psi Executive Committee documents, financial
            reports, general meeting minutes, correspondences, memorandums, notices and agendas as
            well as documents from some of the Boulé’s committees. The bulk of the documents were
            created by the officers and members of Beta Psi Boulé and the officers of the Grand
            Boulé with the exception of some correspondence and event brochures of other Greek
            letter fraternities and sororities, Capital District businesses and charitable
            organizations. </p>
          <p>As the majority of administrative records were created by the executive committee of
            the fraternity, please note that these officers are elected by the members of the Boulé
            every two years. This change in record creators and keepers is reflected in the way
            meeting packets are arranged year by year. Beta Psi had its fewest members immediately
            after it received its charter. Therefore the first few years of administrative records
            are filed into single folders by the creator. As the Boulé grew and officers changed,
            record keeping changed in the way the materials were created, distributed and retained.
            Some years' agendas were sent out with notices, financial reports were stored with
            meeting minutes, and executive and general meetings were kept together. In other years,
            the agendas and meeting minutes are together. Most recently, minutes, agendas, and
            financial reports all have their own folders. The archivist retained this original order
            for all years.</p>
          <p>The transformation of the official Beta Psi header and the Sigma Pi Phi insignia can be
            mapped over the years by the documents in this series. </p>

            <p>The files were compiled by the Beta Psi Boulé for archival use and contain records
              created from 1997 to 2004. The original order of the files was kept since the creator
              grouped many related files into folders. The files include records of the 15th
              Regional Conference, the Beta Nu Conference web materials, Beta Psi administrative
              records, documents from the Seth Spellman Fund, Boulé graphics, photographs, programs
              and lists from annual events, rituals, and constitutions and by-laws. </p>
