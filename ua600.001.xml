      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>"The Performing Arts Center at the University at Albany was constructed in 1969. The facility replaced the aging theater space on the Downtown Campus, Page Hall.</p>
      <p> "Page Hall, named for David Perkins Page, was constructed as part of a major upgrade for the New York State College for Teachers in 1929. Page Hall served as the primary performance space for the College until it was announced in the early 1960's that a new campus was to be constructed. This new construction was to include a state-of-the-art performing arts facility.</p>
      <p> "In 1962, the New York State College for Teachers became the State University of New York at Albany (now called simply the University at Albany) and a new campus located on the west end of Albany was planned. The new facility was designed by noted architect Edward Durell Stone, designer of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. By 1966, students were occupying the new campus, although the entire project was not completed until 1969.</p>
      <p> "On Wednesday, April 16, 1969, the Performing Arts Center on the Uptown Campus was dedicated. The Performing Arts Center, also known as the PAC, was the last building on the academic podium to be completed and was hailed a marvelous achievement by arts professionals and the media alike. The Departments of Music and Theatre were moved into their new home in late April, 1969.</p>
      <p> "The Performing Arts Center has served as the primary performance space for the University for over forty years. Page Hall continues to play host to a fairly large number of events as well. Over eight thousand performances have taken place in the facilities. Although the primary user of the PAC continues to be its resident, the Department of Music and Theatre, many other organizations, on campus and off, have held their events in its excellent facilities. The Performing Arts Center is a unique, important and exciting 'jewel in the crown' of the University at Albany."</p>
