      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The New York Republican State Committee (NYRSC) is the legislative branch for the New York Republican Party. Acting as an oversight committee for all of the county committees in the state of New York, the State Committee nominates Republican candidates for state and federal positions. The NYRSC consists of a group of elected officials including at least one delegate from each assembly district. The State Committee has two parts: the main body and an executive committee that acts as the ruling body within the NYRSC. During times when the NYRSC is not in session, the executive board acts in its place [New York Republican State Committee. <emph render="italic">Rulebook for the Republican State Committee of New York State</emph> (New York: New York Republican State Committee, June 13, 1978)]. The chair of the NYRSC presides over the full committee while a separate chair presides over the executive committee. This group sends two delegates to the Republican National Convention, along with three delegates and three alternate delegates from each Congressional District and six at large delegates.</p>
      <p>The official date set for the founding of the NYRSC is 1855, one year after the founding of the Republican Party in the United States. William Seward and Thurlow Weed are credited with the creation of the state party. In the beginning, the NYRSC met infrequently. Besides the occasional meeting during campaign time, the only mandatory meeting for the NYRSC was every three years to make arrangements for the National Convention. The Committee also did not have a written code of rules [Booraem, Hendrik V. <emph render="italic">The Formation of the Republican Party in New York: Politics and Conscience in the Antebellum North</emph> (New York University Press: New York, 1983)]. Currently, the NYRSC is required to meet following every election.</p>
      <p>Until 1911, with the passage of the Direct Primary Law, the State of New York nominated candidates through a primary or caucus system. In the primary system, the Republican Party candidate for state and federal offices was chosen by a select few. The party voters, or those designated as official electors for each election district met several months before the primary and selected candidates for local offices and delegates to the county, assembly, senatorial and congressional district conventions. The county chairs then nominated candidates for county offices and delegates for the state committee. The average voter had little input in the choice of candidate for the various state and federal offices [Ray, P. Orman. <emph render="italic">An Introduction to Political Parties and Practical Politics</emph> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1913.), 94].</p>
      <p>Referred to as "machine-controlled" or "boss-controlled" politics, this system of nominating candidates for state and federal offices was considered a corrupt practice that left the majority of the voting populous of the Republican Party out of the process of nominating candidates. The electors tended to be selected from the highest officials in the Republican Party. In 1909, Governor Charles E. Hughes brought this issue to the statewide level. He believed that allowing the power to nominate candidates to rest on the shoulders of party leaders tempted them to manipulate the "party machinery" for their own gain [Feldman, "The Direct Primary in New York State", <emph render="italic">The American Political Science Review</emph> 11, Issue 3 (August 1917), 494]. The State Convention of New York had essentially become a ratifying body to support the whims of the party bosses. The current system, established in 1911 with the passage of the Direct Primary Law, allows for more input from the entire voting populous present at the primary. The party voters are allowed to choose unofficial party candidates but the rest of the NYRSC is allowed to petition this decision by writing in another candidate who can then be voted on.</p>
      <p>In 1894, a clause in the New York State Constitution established the legislative districts in both houses of the state legislature. Fearing that the influx of immigrants would tip the balance of Democratic voters in the demographically larger New York City, the NYRSC reapportioned the voting districts in Upstate New York in such a manner that allowed more votes to be cast per voting district. This clause also stated that every county, except for Hamilton and Fulton, must have at least one member in the assembly and that no two counties divided by a river (New York, Manhattan, and Kings) could hold one-half of the seats in the State Senate [Colby, Peter W. "New York State Today", <emph render="italic">New York State Today</emph> (State University at Albany Press: Albany, 1985]. This clause had a major effect on the political landscape of New York until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed it in the 1970s with the one-person one vote decision.</p>
      <p>In 1974, the long standing uneven distribution of voting districts that gave Republican Upstate New York an edge over Democrat controlled New York City came to an end. The United States Supreme Court ruled that the clause creating the top-heavy Upstate New York voting districts was unconstitutional. This ruling caused a massive reapportioning of the voting districts of New York. This had a profound effect on New York State politics. The Republican Party in New York lost its formidable hold on the state legislature. Most of the NYRSC's limited money went to the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Malcolm Wilson in 1974. This loss ushered in a 20-year period during which the Democratic Party dominated the governor's office and the state legislature.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The records of the New York Republican State Committee document the activities of this organization and its role as the coordinator of state and federal Republican elections in New York from 1888-1994. This record group contains meeting agendas and minutes, political literature, speeches, correspondence, photographs, political films, membership lists, and delegate information for state and national Republican conventions. In addition to the NYRSC's records, this collection also includes their reference collection consisting of several volumes that contain the names and addresses of officers in the state and federal legislature, the New York State constitution, and other volumes.</p>
      <p>A great deal of the material was found in binders or folders arranged chronologically, so the original order has been maintained for the most part. Materials arranged under the Speeches and Correspondence Series did not fit in with a particular meeting found within the Conventions and Committee Meetings Series, so rather than interrupt the natural order of the series by interspersing items that were not originally grouped with them, it seemed more logical to put them into their own series. This series makes up the bulk of the NYRSC's records. It includes an almost uninterrupted run of minutes and agendas from 1911-1994.</p>
      <p>Some items in the collection can be found in both bound and unbound versions. This is the case for the minutes of the New York Republican State Committee, Republican National Committee (RNC), and the Republican Organization. The minutes of the NYRSC and RNC can be found unbound covering the years from 1911 to 1994 in Series 1 and in bound versions covering the years from 1906-1928 and from 1930-1934 in oversized boxes. The New York Republican Organization can be found unbound covering the years 1908 to 1949 in Series 2 and unbound covering the years from 1908 to 1936 shelved with Series 8.</p>

      <p>There are mild preservation issues with the collection. Given the frequent use and leather bindings of the Legislative Manuals, many were deteriorating and have been boxed for protection. There is also significant wear on the bound copies of the convention and committee meeting minutes as they represent some of the oldest records in this collection. The original films are also in fragile condition and may not be viewed, but use copies in VHS and DVD format are available for all of the films except "Portrait of a Senator", the sprocket holes of which were in too poor condition to allow the film to be reformatted at this time. The collection includes several unidentified pictures that have been filed in the Photographs and Biographical Information Series in the photographs folder.</p>

          <p>Series 1 includes the proceedings from New York State Republican Committee meetings. One of its most useful features is the quantity of information about legislation passed and the voting statistics for counties. These would be useful for those writing political histories; one could follow trends in voting patterns to determine how the composition of counties has changed and what issues have become more important than others. Another useful element one can find in this series is the differences of voting trends in times of war and depression. The minutes also give insight into the various personalities of those involved in state politics. The minutes are also good sources of quotations for particular committee members' stands on legislation. Many of the minutes include the current party platform, allowing one to determine how the goals of the party have changed over time. An in-depth picture of the New York Republican State Committee is available through the minutes.</p>
          <p>The series includes more than just the minutes taken at meetings. One also finds the original letters sent out to the various members of the NYRSC, RNC, and the county chairs. This series also contains correspondence that directly relates to specific meetings or conventions of the NYRSC and the RNC. At times one finds opinions that would not be voiced in a general meeting, so these pieces of correspondence are a good way to measure the actual tenor of the State Committee at a given time.</p>
          <p>The series also includes the binders used by the members of the Committee for Arrangements for the 1984 and 1988 National Republican Conventions. The binders are the first drafts supplied to delegates to the Convention. They include information on accommodations, the city in which the convention is going to take place, news and media coverage surrounding the convention, security measures to be put in place at the convention, and transportation information. These also include the minutes from the planning meetings held by the National Republican Committee before the conventions occurred.</p>

            <p>The <emph render="italic">Republican Organization of the State of New York</emph> gives lists of delegates and alternates to the State and National Committees. The <emph render="italic">Republican Organization of the State of New York</emph> is a quick reference guide that indicates the names of county chairs, the vote tallies for state and federal elections by county and the major resolutions passed by the State and National Committees each year. These would be excellent guides for anyone needing to find the name of an officer or the margin of votes by which an officer was elected. One could find similar uses for these sources of information as with the rolls of the State and National Committees.</p>

            <p>The <emph render="italic">Roll Books of the Delegates and Alternates to the National Republican Conventions</emph> act as quick reference guides for finding out who attended each convention. These booklets list the delegates and alternates along with their districts and addresses. They also give a list of the number of delegates sent by each state, a list of the Republican National Convention delegates since the founding of the Republican Party in 1856, a list of the contemporary Republican National Committee, a tally of the electoral vote by state, a list of locations for the National Convention and the candidate elected during that convention. They lend themselves to demographic studies focusing on the ratio of women delegates to male delegates that have served at the National Convention. An especially interesting study would be to compare the information found within the State rolls to the roles of the Republican National Convention.</p>

            <p>The dinner programs from various Republican events include programs from the 15th District Republican Club Dinners, the Ivy Club Dinners and other Republican events. The pictures contained in these programs would be valuable, as it would allow one to put faces to many names that would remain faceless otherwise. One can also find the names of the Republican Club's officers.</p>

            <p>This sub-series includes pamphlets, newsletters, and a phonograph record that were given to prospective Republican voters. One finds campaign pamphlets from 1938 and 1944. The 1938 pamphlet is called "Don't Say We Didn't Warn You!" It paints the chair of the Republican County Committee Kenneth Simpson as a reluctant hero who was responsible for bringing morality back to New York after the Democratic Tammany Hall scandals. The 1944 pamphlet is a biography of Sidney Hillman who was the chair of the Political Action Committee and leader of the American Labor Party.</p>
            <p>Also included are newsletters called "Public Affairs" and published by the Committee on Public Affairs for the Republican Party of Monroe County. These cover September 13 through October 29, 1941, the time period from the primary election, where a Republican candidate is nominated, to the general election. The scope of these newsletters is confined to Monroe County. These newsletters provide the committee members of Monroe County with important information about upcoming Republican events, voter information and information about the candidate. These newsletters are meant as guides to ensure that each committee member is knowledgeable about the process of nominating a candidate and how to spread the Republican ideology to the people of Monroe County. This series also includes a campaign phonograph record for Nelson Rockefeller from the 1960s entitled "Nelson Rockefeller Talks with YOU".</p>

          <p>This series includes the rulebooks and manuals used by the NYRSC to regulate committee meetings and conventions. <emph render="italic">The Political Calendar of the Republican Party of New York</emph> are included in this series because they provide dates for filing primary petitions, conventions, registration for large and small cities and towns, and what color forms must be used to record these actions. <emph render="italic">The Political Calendar</emph> also supplies the percentage of votes one needs to nominate a candidate for a primary. These span from 1939 through 1963. The collection also includes the rulebooks for state and national conventions. These supply the delegate with the proper decorum for conduct in a convention, explain the functions of each position in the committee, explain the processes of electing and removing officials, and give regulations as to when a meeting must be called. The collection only has the 1976 version of the <emph render="italic">National Convention Rulebook</emph>. The collection also has a training manual for women county vice-chairs of the Republican Party, complete with a series of pamphlets on the subject of learning how to become a community leader, how to manage speakers, special interest groups, and large events, and how to build the Republican Party in one's neighborhood.</p>

          <p>One of the functions of the Republican State Committee is to act as the provider of positive press on the various campaigns across the state. To achieve this, the NYRSC kept a file of photographs and biographical statements for the press. Although there is a picture of Henrietta Wells Livermore, founder of the Federal Women's Republican Club from 1919, the bulk of the collection is from the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the photographs are marked with the names of those pictured, but there are a few unidentified photos.</p>
          <p>The collection includes photographs or biographies of Richard M. Nixon, George H. W. Bush, Henrietta Wells Livermore, Eunice B. Whittlesey, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Robert Dole, Jacob K. Javits, Malcolm Wilson, and many others.</p>

          <p>This series includes miscellaneous speeches and other communications not immediately related to meetings found within the Conventions and Committees series. Other communications found in this series are Nelson Rockefeller's Addresses to the Legislature. Again, these did not occur during a specific meeting, but rather were sent to the various members of the legislature reporting on the progress of the Republican Party during the given year.</p>

          <p>The films in the collection document Republicans and the Republican Party from the 1950s through the 1970s. The films include portraits of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, former President Dwight Eisenhower, presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, and President Richard Nixon after his first year in the White House. Four of the films were from the Campaign School Series of the Republican National Committee used in the elections of 1956. The original films were formatted on 8mm and 16mm film. Use copies in VHS and DVD format are available for use in the Department for all of the films except "Portrait of a Senator", the sprocket holes of which were in too poor condition to allow the film to be reformatted at this time.</p>

            <p>The <emph render="italic">Legislative Manuals of New York</emph> were most likely used by the NYRSC as handy sources of historical and current political information. These volumes make it possible to track voter trends as they also focused on the activities of the Democratic Party. Within these compact volumes, one finds a wealth of information about the political make-up of New York.</p>
            <p>One of the major topics covered in these volumes are voting trends in New York counties. From this data, one can find out how many males and females registered to vote and how many voted for Democratic and Republican candidates in the state and federal elections. The <emph render="italic">Legislative Manuals of New York</emph> also include descriptions of state offices and departments and officers who held positions in them. The descriptions include pictures of the officers, short biographical statements, functions of the office and the annual salary. One can also find lists of congressional districts. These lists are an excellent way of determining how congressional districts have changed shape over the years. Finally, these volumes contain interesting facts about New York State, including the origins of county names, the meaning of the New York seal, the state bird of New York, and the dates they were established.</p>

Unlike the <emph render="italic">Legislative Manuals</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New York Red Book</emph> does not contain statistics about voter history in a region. These books can be used to determine who served on state committees such as the Board of Education or Health. They also include the tallies of votes for the elections for each state office, who the candidates were and by what margin they won. Some even supply the breakdown of Republican, Democratic and Independent votes. Although the <emph render="italic">Legislative Manuals</emph> and <emph render="italic">Red Book</emph> contain similar information, they differ in scope. While the <emph render="italic">Legislative Manual</emph> gives a broad view of the entire state legislature, the <emph render="italic">New York Red Book</emph> takes a more in-depth view of the representatives. The <emph render="italic">Legislative Manuals</emph> would be useful for statistical data, whereas the <emph render="italic">New York Red Books</emph> are more useful for personal data. The biographies give district, education and family information, political offices and other jobs.</p>
