      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Alice Walsh Tedford Whelan, an Albany native, was born in 1915, the daughter of Dr. Robert H. Tedford.  She had two half-sisters, Harriet Tedford Doughton and Katherine Tedford Nelson, and five full siblings, Delaphine Tedford Brower, Robert Hill Tedford, Eleanor Searls Tedford, Edith Tedford Hendricks, and Olive Tedford Johnson, Alice's twin sister.  A graduate of St. Agnes' School, Albany, in 1932, she attended Middlebury College, 1932-33, and Beaver College, where she graduated in 1936.  In 1938, she graduated from the New York State College for Teachers with a degree in librarianship.  Her half-sister Harriet Tedford Doughton had graduated from the NYSCT in 1916.  Alice Tedford married David Whelan on June 28, 1941, and the couple had two children:  David Richard Whelan, a biographer and historian, and Nancy Whelan Parrella. </p>
      <p>Alice Tedford Whalen began her library career at the Delmar Public Library (1937-38), then worked at the Albany Public Library (1938).  Afterwards she moved to Westchester County and worked in school libraries:  Elmsford (1938-43), Tarrytown (1943-46), Chappaqua (1955-67).  She moved back to the capital district in 1967 and began work as a school librarian in Burnt Hills, where she remained until 1974.  She currently lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The four diaries in this manuscript collection were kept in commercial five-year diary books.  Because of the limitations of space, most entries consist of abbreviated accounts of Alice T. Whelan's day as a young graduate of St. Agnes' School, Albany, her summer vacations at Round Lake, N.Y.; student life at Middlebury College, 1932-33, Beaver College, 1933-36, and the State College for Teachers Library School, 1937-38; and her daily life after moving to Westchester County.  Inserted between the pages of the diary are a number of small items including photographs of family and friends, newspaper clippings, lockets of hair, pressed leaves, notes from friends, railway tickets.  The diaries begin on June 1932 and end in November 1948.  Few daily entries are missed.  Many members of her family are mentioned in the diaries. </p>
