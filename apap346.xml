      <p>A graduate of Amherst College and The University of Michigan Law School, Eugene G. Wanger returned home to Lansing, Michigan to practice law after obtaining his degree. In 1961-1962 fellow voters from Lansing elected him the youngest delegate from his political party to Michiganâs Constitutional Convention where, among other provisions, he authored the section of the state constitution which bans capital punishment. Mr. Wanger later served as Lansing's City Attorney and chairman of Ingham County's Board of Commissioners.</p>
      <p> Beginning in 1972, Mr. Wanger has co-chaired the Michigan Committee Against Capital Punishment, co-founded the Michigan Committee Against the Death Penalty, and been active in numerous historical organizations. In 2005, he received the Champion of Justice Award from the State Bar of Michigan for superior professional accomplishments benefiting the state and nation, including his work on capital punishment.</p>
      <p> Marilyn G. Wanger, born Marilyn Morris in Mason, Michigan, is a graduate of Michigan State University and The University of Michigan Law School where she met Mr. Wanger. During her professional career, she served as a Michigan Assistant Attorney General and then as a Commissioner of Michigan's Court of Appeals. </p>
