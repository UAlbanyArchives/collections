      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Walter Friedländer, born in 1891 in Berlin, was a prominent leader of the reform
                movement in the fields of social policy, social welfare and public health in Weimar
                (pre-Hitler) Germany. Friedländer, an active Social Democrat and a Jew, was forced
                to flee Nazi Germany in March of 1933, and eventually immigrated to the United
                States via France, where he continued to play a leading role as an educator and
                leader in the field of social work and social welfare education in this country.</p>
      <p>Walter Friedländer was born on September 20, 1891 in Berlin, the oldest son of Hugo
                and Ernestine (Lichtenstein) Friedländer. He grew up under the socialist-oriented
                influences of his father, a founding member of the pacifist Deutsche
                Friedensgesellschaft, and later under the influences of his uncle, socialist
                politician Hugo Haase. In autobiographical statements, Friedländer describes the
                influences of the youth movements (Jugendbewegung) in Weimar Germany and his
                membership in the Sozialistischer Studentbund during his student years in Berlin. As
                a law student in Berlin and Munich (1910-1914), Friedländer became interested in the
                development of juvenile justice and volunteered his time doing probation work. He
                also met and later became engaged to Li Bergmann (1914), also involved in the youth
                movement in Berlin, and they were married in February 1919.</p>
      <p>Friedländer served in the German army from 1916 to 1918, and after his return to
                Berlin in 1919 became actively involved in politics. He was first elected as a
                delegate for the USPD (Independent Social Democrats) to the district assembly in
                Schmargendorf in 1920, and in April 1921, to district councilor in the Prenzlauer
                Berg section of Berlin.</p>
      <p>Friedländer's first involvement with the field of youth welfare and social work was
                through the juvenile justice movement, which was just gaining momentum in Berlin
                around the time he began his legal studies. His teachers included Paul Kahl and
                Franz von Liszt, leaders in the juvenile justice movement. The influence of Liszt
                and his daughter, Elsa von Liszt, led to Friedländer's involvement in the Deutsche
                Zentrale für Jugendfürsorge, a private youth welfare organization in Berlin, where
                he at first participated on a voluntary basis, and later served an internship during
                the first two years of World War I.</p>
      <p>Social democratic policy regarding youth welfare was developed in Germany after 1918
                by a relatively small group of individuals, among them Hans Caspari, Marie Juchacz,
                Helene Simon and Walter Friedländer. The central idea of social democratic youth
                welfare policy was the child's right to education and material assistance provided
                by the state, set up by the Arbeiterwohlfahrt, the workers' welfare organization
                founded by the Social Democrats in 1919. The Fachkommission für Jugendwohlfahrt
                (Youth Welfare Commission), created in 1925 and attached to the headquarters of
                Arbeiterwohlfahrt, was chaired by Friedländer from 1925 until his dismissal in 1933.
                Its members included Helene Simon, Hedwig Wachenheim, Hans Maier, Otto Krebs, Rudolf
                Schlosser and Louise Schröder. The youth welfare committee drafted parliamentary
                resolutions for the SPD, formulated reform proposals and compiled reports on
                problems of youth welfare. In addition, the intent was to provide youth welfare
                committee members with representation at major youth welfare conferences and on
                central committees of the established youth welfare organizations. Friedländer also
                became Chairman of the Deutsche Zentrale für freie Jugendwohlfahrt in 1931.</p>
      <p>In his twelve years as District Councilor and Director of Youth Welfare in Prenzlauer
                Berg, the district gained a reputation for developing new and innovative programs in
                social, and especially youth, welfare, with particular emphasis on the areas of
                juvenile delinquency (rehabilitation) and youth unemployment.</p>
      <p>Friedländer escaped from Germany in February 1933, ostensibly to attend an
                international conference of the International League of Social Welfare in Geneva in
                March of 1933. He was officially dismissed from his position in March 1933 and
                remained in Switzerland after the conference, where his wife and young daughter
                joined him in May.</p>
      <p>He left for Paris in June 1933 at the invitation of the French Minister of Education,
                however his promise of employment evaporated with the fall of the French cabinet.
                Instead, Friedländer became co-director of a legal counseling service for political
                refugees from Germany and helped to set up other organizations to aid his fellow
                refugees. With the aid of a fellow political refugee from Germany, (John) Otto
                Reinemann, who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1934, Friedländer received an invitation
                to lecture at the University of Chicago in 1936 and left Paris in December of the
                same year.</p>
      <p>The Friedländers arrived in Chicago in January 1937, where Walter lectured in the
                Department of Social Welfare of the University of Chicago until 1943. He also worked
                as a librarian for the Chicago Jewish vocational service and, at the same time, set
                up a refugee organization, Selfhelp for Immigrants, patterned after a similar
                organization founded by Paul Tillich in New York.</p>
      <p>In 1943, the same year he became an American citizen, Friedländer left Chicago to
                lecture at the University of California in Berkeley, where he eventually became
                professor in the School of Social Welfare and taught until his emeritation in
                1959.</p>
      <p>Although Friedländer's career in the U.S. became less politically active, he
                continued to maintain his contacts with Social Democrats and members of the
                Arbeiterwohlfahrt in post-war Germany, and his correspondence with U.S. politicians
                is evidence to his continued interest in political affairs.</p>
      <p>Friedländer's primary focus in the U.S. became his teaching and writing. Social work
                training had always been a strong concern for Friedländer during his tenure as
                Stadtrat (Councilor) in Prenzlauer Berg (Berlin) and teaching consumed a
                considerable portion of his energies even during this time period. In addition to
                pursuing an active teaching career at the Social Welfare Departments of the
                University of Chicago and the University of California, Berkeley, Friedländer
                continued to publish monographs and later textbooks in the field of social work and
                social welfare. His most successful work, Introduction to Social Welfare (first
                published in 1955, and reprinted in 1957, 1968, 1974 and 1979), became the standard
                basic textbook for social welfare courses throughout the United States. Friedländer
                also continued to pursue his interest in comparative social work, as evidenced both
                in his active participation in numerous international social welfare conferences, as
                well as his publications (including Concepts and Methods of Social Work, 1958 and
                1976, and International Social Welfare, 1975).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Walter A. Friedländer (Friedlander) Papers consist of 45 archival boxes of
                materials, dating primarily from 1932 to 1984, with a small number of items dating
                from as early as 1914. The largest part (nearly two-thirds) of the collection is
                comprised of Friedländer's voluminous correspondence (30 boxes). The collection also
                contains biographical materials, manuscripts and publications by Friedländer, as
                well as course materials and materials pertaining to national and international
                social welfare conferences, publications by other scholars, and materials collected
                by Friedländer on topics of interest, particularly social welfare topics.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into nine series: 1) biographical materials; 2)
                correspondence; 3) manuscripts; 4) publications; 5) conference materials; 6) course
                and lecture materials; 7) offprints and publications by other scholars; 8) materials
                collected by Friedländer; and 9) diplomas.</p>
      <p>The voluminous correspondence, dating primarily from 1932-1984, contains over 40,000
                letters predominantly by and to Walter A. Friedländer. The major portion of the
                correspondence is professional in nature and includes correspondences with numerous
                prominent professionals in the fields of social work and social welfare,
                correspondence with social welfare organizations, government officials and
                politicians, and correspondence concerning publications by Friedländer.</p>
      <p>Friedländer's publications are also well-represented in the collection with
                typescript and manuscript versions of many of his published writings, as well as
                published versions of his books and journal articles. Included in the collection of
                manuscripts and published works are many early articles (1926-1933), which were
                written by Friedländer during his years as Head of the Youth Welfare Commission in
                the Prenzlauer-Berg section of the city of Berlin, Germany.</p>
      <p>Also noteworthy to the collection is the section containing materials pertaining to
                various conferences, predominantly on social work/welfare. Especially
                well-represented are the International Conferences on Social Work / Welfare
                (1937-1974), especially the Munich Conference of 1956.</p>
      <p>In addition, the collection also contains a large number of supporting materials on
                topics in social work and social welfare, which Friedländer collected to support his
                research interests. These include offprints and publications by other scholars,
                course and lecture notes, and clipping/materials files on individuals or topics.</p>

          <p>This series contains autobiographical and biographical materials, including
                        documents, curriculum vitae, appointment books, membership cards and awards,
                        as well as documents concerning Friedländer's position at the Deutsche
                        Zentrale für freie Jugendwohlfahrt in Berlin, as well as later teaching
                        appointments at the University of Chicago, University of California,
                        Berkeley, and Michigan State University. Included in the early documents
                        from Berlin are his dismissal papers from the Deutsche Zentrale für freie
                        Jugendwohlfahrt in 1933, documentation of his years in Switzerland and
                        France, 1933-1936, affidavits and letters of support in preparation for his
                        immigration to the U.S. in 1937. Also included in this series are several
                        autobiographical statements, which document the development of social
                        welfare and social welfare education in Germany and the United States.</p>

          <p>This series contains typescripts and manuscripts of full-length works,
                        including textbooks; typescripts and manuscripts of journal publications in
                        German and in English; and typescripts and manuscripts of books reviewed by
                        Friedländer. Versions of several of Friedländer's full-length works are
                        present, including: Einführung in die soziale Wohlfahrt, Helene Simon,
                        Individualism &amp; Social Welfare, International Social Welfare, and
                        Introduction to Social Welfare. Versions of many of Friedländer's
                        German-language journal articles (184 folders), 1931-1984, include many
                        articles dating from the 1930s dealing with topics and problems associated
                        with Friedländer's experiences as Head of the Jugendamt in the
                        Prenzlauer-Berg section of Berlin until 1933. Also present in this section
                        are typescripts and manuscripts of journal articles written in English (49
                        folders), 1932-1979. The final section (62 folders) contains typescripts and
                        manuscripts of book reviews by W.F. in both German and English.</p>
