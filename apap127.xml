      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>In 1938, the New York State Legislature authorized the construction of Willowbrook
                State School on Staten Island as a residential facility for developmentally disabled
                children and adults. By the time construction was complete, the United States had
                entered World War II, and the federal government took control of the facility for
                use as a hospital. The first developmentally disabled residents did not start move
                in until 1947. Willowbrook was originally intended to house fewer than 3,000
                residents, but by 1955 it housed over 3,500 residents. By 1963, 6,000 residents
                lived in buildings intended to hold only 4,275 [Rothman, David J. and Shelia M.
                Rothman, <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook Wars</emph>, New York: Harper and
                Row, 1984, 22-23].</p>
      <p>Overcrowding and staff apathy resulted in extremely poor conditions for Willowbrook
                residents. A New York State legislative committee toured Willowbrook in 1963 and was
                horrified by what they saw, but the committee's findings were kept confidential. In
                1965, Senator Robert Kennedy referred to Willowbrook as a "snake pit" after an
                unannounced visit to the facility. New York State responded by developing a
                five-year plan to improve care for the developmentally disabled in all state
                facilities, but the plan failed to make the necessary improvements [Rothman, David
                J. and Shelia M. Rothman, <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook Wars</emph>, New
                York: Harper and Row, 1984, 23].</p>
      <p>In 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a local reporter for TV station WABC in New York, drew
                national attention to Willowbrook's deplorable conditions through a televised
                expose. Rivera was contacted on January 6, 1972 by Michael Wilkins, an old friend.
                Wilkins had been employed as a staff physician at Willowbrook, but was fired for
                stirring up trouble at the facility after advocating for change in the care of
                residents. Wilkins still had a key to the Willowbrook buildings, and he offered to
                provide access to Rivera and a camera crew. The next day, Rivera and his crew filmed
                footage of conditions in Willowbrook's Building 6. The story aired that night and
                included shocking images of children lying on floors naked and drinking out of
                toilet bowls. Public outcry began almost immediately [Rothman, David J. and Shelia
                M. Rothman, <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook Wars</emph>, New York: Harper and
                Row, 1984, 17].</p>
      <p>On March 17, 1972, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of Willowbrook
                residents by the New York Association for Retarded Citizens and several parents of
                Willowbrook residents. The lawsuit was prepared by Bruce Ennis of the Mental Health
                Law Project. Legal counsel was also provided by the New York Civil Liberties Union.
                On December 18, 1972, a five-day hearing on the issue of preliminary relief was
                held. Preliminary relief was intended to prevent the condition of Willowbrook
                residents from deteriorating further while legal proceedings took place. Although
                preliminary relief was granted by Judge Orrin Judd, the plaintiffs were dissatisfied
                with its terms. In contrast, the final outcome of the lawsuit - a Consent Decree
                officially accepted on April 30, 1975 following lengthy negotiations between the two
                sides - was viewed by the plaintiffs as a major victory for Willowbrook residents
                [Rothman, David J. and Shelia M. Rothman, <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook
                    Wars</emph>, New York: Harper and Row, 1984, 57-60, 123]. (The Consent Decree is
                sometimes referred to as the Consent Judgment in the Review Panel's records).</p>
      <p>The Consent Decree was a twenty-nine page document that set new standards for the
                care of Willowbrook residents. Its stipulations were aimed at improving the
                physical, social, and educational environment of Willowbrook Developmental Center.
                Most significantly, it required the state to reduce the population of Willowbrook
                from 5400 to about 250 by moving residents out of the institution and into small,
                community-based residences. (Although the Consent Decree stated that this reduction
                in Willowbrook population was to occur by 1981, this deadline proved unfeasible. The
                Consent Decree was not fully implemented until 1987.) The guiding principle of the
                Consent Decree was that all Willowbrook class members were entitled to the "least
                restrictive" living environment possible. In short, it called for the largest mass
                deinstitutionalization in the history of the United States [Rothman, David J. and
                Shelia M. Rothman, <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook Wars</emph>, New York:
                Harper and Row, 1984, 1-2].</p>
      <p>The Willowbrook Review Panel (WRP), was intended as a temporary arm of the court
                which would monitor implementation of Consent Decree guidelines at Willowbrook. It
                consisted of seven members, all experts in the field of mental retardation. The
                Consent Decree called for three members to be chosen by the plaintiffs, two by the
                defendants, and two appointed jointly. Plaintiffs selected Linda Glenn, who was
                experienced with community placement of developmentally disabled individuals in
                Nebraska; Michael Lottman, an expert in mental health law and an attorney with the
                Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice; and Murray Schneps, a
                lawyer and parent of a Willowbrook resident. Defendants selected William Bittner, an
                assistant commissioner in the state Department of Education; and James Forde, the
                acting director of Willowbrook. Jointly appointed were James Clements, head of the
                Georgia Retardation Center; and David Rosen, who headed community programs for the
                developmentally disabled in Detroit [Rothman, David J. and Shelia M. Rothman, <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook Wars</emph>, New York: Harper and Row, 1984, 57,
                76, 101, 127-128, 130]. The Panel held regular meetings twice a month, usually for
                two days at a time, and issued reports to the court every six months.</p>
      <p>The terms of the Consent Decree also provided for professional staff members, paid by
                New York State, to support the Panel's activities. These staff members included
                several Program Associates and an Executive Director. Jennifer Howse was the Panel's
                first Executive Director. In 1978, she left the Review Panel to become head of the
                Metropolitan Placement Unit, the state agency responsible for developing community
                residences for Willowbrook class members. Kathy Schwaninger replaced Howse as the
                Executive Director. Panel staff members worked out of an office located in the World
                Trade Center.</p>
      <p>According to the Consent Decree, the role of the Panel was simple: to investigate the
                state's progress towards implementing the Consent Decree and to report to the court
                on the State's progress. Little was said, however, about how the Panel should
                accomplish this goal. The Panel took an extremely proactive approach, developing a
                complex system of standards and audit instruments against which to measure New
                York's progress toward improving conditions at Willowbrook.</p>
      <p>The influence of the Review Panel also extended far beyond Willowbrook itself. The
                terms of the Consent Decree applied to all who resided at Willowbrook as of March
                17, 1972, the date that the class action lawsuit was filed. This group, called the
                Willowbrook Class of 1972, included many people who had subsequently been
                transferred out of Willowbrook and into other state residential facilities. Many
                residents were transferred out of Willowbrook by the state between the initial
                filing of the class action lawsuit and the issuing of the Consent Decree. This was
                seen as a deliberate attempt by the state to improve its image by voluntarily
                reducing the Willowbrook population. The Review Panel monitored conditions in these
                related facilities, and the related facilities were held to the same exacting
                standards as Willowbrook. The Panel also took an avid interest in the placement of
                Willowbrook class members in community residences. The Panel closely followed the
                activities of the Metropolitan Placement Unit, a New York State Agency established
                to create acceptable, non-institutional living situations for class members.</p>
      <p>The Panel was disbanded in 1980 for political reasons. Some in state government saw
                the Panel as a waste of money, and the state Office of Mental Retardation and
                Developmental Disabilities had long resented that an instrument of the Federal court
                had been given such influence over the office. Because of these political pressures,
                the New York State Legislature failed to fund the Review Panel for the 1981-1982
                fiscal years. District Court Judge John Bartels, who took over the Willowbrook case
                following the death of Judge Orrin Judd in 1976, ordered the Governor and the Office
                of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities to fund the Panel or be found
                in contempt of court. The state appealed, and Bartels' order was overturned by a
                higher court [Rothman, David J. and Shelia M. Rothman, <emph render="italic">The
                    Willowbrook Wars</emph>, New York: Harper and Row, 1984, 315-319].</p>
      <p>For a detailed discussion of the Review Panel's activities, as well as discussion of
                the Consent Decree's importance for the care of the developmentally disabled, see
                    <emph render="italic">The Willowbrook Wars</emph> by David J. Rothman and Sheila
                M. Rothman. The Rothmans, both social science researchers, used the Consent Decree
                as a case study of deinstitutionalization and community placement. The Review Panel
                gave the Rothmans extensive access to their meetings and files during the period
                1978-1981. A copy of their original research proposal is located in Series 9, Box 5,
                Folder 5.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Willowbrook Review Panel records provide extensive documentation of the Panel's
                main function: monitoring implementation of the Willowbrook Consent Decree in New
                York State. There are near-complete files on audits conducted by the Panel at
                Willowbrook and other state residential facilities, containing everything from raw
                data gathered by auditors to final reports on audit findings. The Review Panel's
                extensive files on community placement illuminate the process of finding family care
                and small group living situations for thousands of developmentally disabled citizens
                of New York State. A lengthy run of 90 Day Progress Reports written by Willowbrook
                officials for the Panel documents New York's attempts to bring the facility into
                compliance with the Consent Decree standards. There are extensive operational plans
                for related facilities, which spell out in detail how facility staff sought to
                improve the quality of life for Willowbrook class members.</p>
      <p>The Panel maintained files on Willowbrook and related facilities, and these files
                provide a look at New York State's facilities for the developmentally disabled
                during an important period of transition. However, these files are by no means a
                complete picture of each institution, and the depth of documentation varies
                considerably from facility to facility. There are also files related to the New York
                State Department of Mental Hygiene and the Office of Mental Retardation and
                Developmental Disabilities. Particularly notable are the files with correspondence
                between Mental Health Commissioners and the Review Panel.</p>
      <p>The records also document the controversy over Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital. New York
                State planned to move class members from the physically deteriorating Gouveneur Unit
                of the Manhattan Developmental Center to the Mental Retardation Institute of the
                Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital, which was affiliated with New York Medical College.
                Following the move, several residents died unexpectedly, and the Review Panel found
                the standards of care at Flower Fifth to be unacceptable. Files related to Flower
                Fifth include audit materials, information on community placement of Flower Fifth
                residents, evaluations of individual residents conducted by an outside consultant,
                and correspondence.</p>
      <p>Subject files and publications collected by the Review Panel provide a larger context
                for the Willowbrook case. Included in the subject files are files on community
                placement and deinstitutionalization in other areas of the country, as well as
                theoretical writings on topics related to care of the developmentally disabled. News
                clippings from the Staten Island Advance, the New York Times, and other publications
                illustrate how Willowbrook, the Consent Decree, and the developmentally disabled
                themselves were perceived within the surrounding community.</p>
      <p>The records include considerable administrative files, which provide evidence of the
                day-to-day operation of Panel staff. The bulk of the administrative files consist of
                correspondence, mailings, and meeting packets. Almost completely lacking is
                background information on the Panel members, and there is no evidence at all of the
                Panel selection process.</p>
      <p>The records contain little information about Willowbrook Developmental Center in the
                years prior to the Consent Decree; there is little evidence of the circumstances
                that prompted the class action lawsuit of 1972. The New York Civil Liberties Union
                files located at the end of the collection provide the best documentation of the
                legal case itself. There are a few court documents from the Review Panel files in a
                series of their own, but these are not as complete as the NYCLU legal records. The
                records also stop well before the process of closing Willowbrook was completed in
                1987.</p>

      <p>The Willowbrook Review Panel was a Federal monitoring group established by the U.S.
                District Court in 1975 and was dismissed from its duties in 1987. The records were
                house at the American Civil Liberties Union office until cleared by the National
                Archives for restricted access in 2002. Portions of series 1-10 are restricted due
                to the personal information in the records. Researchers must complete a
                non-disclosure form before gaining access and reproductions are not permitted.</p>

          <p>The Review Panel issued formal recommendations to New York State on the
                        implementation of the Willowbrook Consent Decree. If the State chose not to
                        accept the recommendation, the matter was decided by the U.S. District Court
                        judge assigned to the Willowbrook case.</p>
          <p>This series contains correspondence, reports, and court documents related to
                        the Review Panel's formal recommendations. Each recommendation has its own
                        folder, and folders are arranged chronologically by recommendation date. The
                        first 22 recommendations issued by the Panel were numbered in the original
                        filing scheme, but subsequent recommendations were not. The second box
                        contains an index, written in late 1978, for recommendations 1-22, including
                        a summary and outcome for each recommendation. Selected files are restricted
                        because they contain information about specific named residents of
                        Willowbrook and other state developmental centers. These restricted folders
                        are noted below in the box and folder list.</p>

          <p>The Willowbrook Review Panel conducted numerous audits of Willowbrook and
                        other state facilities housing former Willowbrook residents to determine
                        levels of compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree. This series
                        contains data, reports, correspondence, and other materials related to
                        Review Panel audits. Please note that Community Placement Audits are found
                        not in this series, but in the Community Placement series (Series 6).</p>
          <p>Review Panel auditors closely examined the records of selected facility
                        residents as part of the audit process. The series is restricted because it
                        contains medical and educational records of specific named residents of
                        Willowbrook and other state developmental centers.</p>

            <p>The terms of the Willowbrook Consent Decree applied to all people who
                            were residents of Willowbrook on March 17, 1972 (usually referred to as
                            the "Willowbrook Class of 1972"). By the time the Consent Decree was
                            issued, many class members had been transferred to other state-run
                            residential facilities. The Review Panel therefore had the authority -
                            and the responsibility - to ensure that other facilities housing former
                            Willowbrook residents were in compliance with the terms of the Consent
                            Decree. The Panel monitored the compliance of other facilities through a
                            series of Related Facilities Audits.</p>
            <p>This subseries contains files on Related Facilities Audits held in March
                            and September 1977, September 1978, and September 1979. Files are
                            arranged chronologically by audit date. In some cases, data in the
                            collection was not marked with a specific audit date. This undated data
                            is found at the end of the chronological file series. Also found at the
                            end of the series are general related facilities audit files that are
                            not associated with a specific audit date.</p>

            <p>In February 1979 and February 1980, the Review Panel conducted staffing
                            audits of Willowbrook and related facilities to determine if the
                            staff-to-resident ratios required by the Consent Decree were being
                            maintained. For a period of one week, data on staff members signed in
                            for each shift was collected. Ratios of both direct care and supervisory
                            staff were calculated. This series contains data collected from
                            Willowbrook and several related facilities, rough drafts of a report,
                            final compliance reports, and correspondence related to the staffing
                            audits.</p>

            <p>The Review Panel closely monitored the placement of Willowbrook residents
                            in the community and was quick to designate placements as invalid if
                            they did not comply exactly with the terms of the consent Decree. Since
                            it was not feasible for the Panel to review every placement in detail, a
                            series of community placement audits were conducted. Trained auditors
                            examined the records of a sample of all residents placed in a designated
                            time frame, spoke with both the client and the primary care provider,
                            and analyzed the suitability of the client's daily schedule of
                            programming. This subseries contains the raw data from each of these
                            audits including worksheets used by auditors to evaluate each placement,
                            notes from interviews and site visits, and copies of class member
                            records and placement plans. Also included are summaries of audit data
                            and final reports on findings.</p>

            <p>Before a resident could be moved from an institution to a community-based
                            residence, approval had to be obtained from the resident's parent,
                            guardian, or closest living relative, referred to as that resident's
                            "correspondent". Due process regulations required that 30 day notice be
                            given before a resident could be transferred. During this period, a
                            correspondent could formally object to the proposed placement. If an
                            objection was filed, a hearing was held to determine if the placement
                            was in the best interests of the resident. If a resident had no
                            correspondent, the Consumer Advisory Board acted as the resident's
                            representative, filing an objection if warranted and acting as the
                            resident's advocate at the objection hearing.</p>
            <p>This series consists primarily of 30 day notices of impending resident
                            transfer mailed to correspondents by the institution from which the
                            resident was to be moved. Although these are form letters, they usually
                            contain details about the home environment in the proposed community
                            residence. Other supporting materials also appear in these files,
                            including copies of resident placement plans, notification letters to
                            the Review Panel indicating that transfers had occurred, letters from
                            correspondents expressing objections to proposed placements, and reports
                            on placement objection hearings.</p>
            <p>There was originally no single organizational scheme for the materials in
                            this series. Some transfer notifications were arranged alphabetically
                            and others were arranged by date. These two filing schemes have not been
                            integrated. Furthermore, even within each scheme the organization is
                            rough; folders are arranged in relation to each other, but the items
                            within each folder are in no discernible order.</p>

            <p>These files consist of reports, plans, and correspondence related to
                            community placement of Willowbrook residents. There are numerous

                            particular month. There are also printouts listing all members of the
                            Willowbrook class alphabetically, by their residence facility, and by
                            their placement status. Also included are extensive files on the overall
                            Community Placement Plan, which presented guidelines for placing
                            Willowbrook residents in community-based homes. There are also some
                            subject files; topics include Borough Developmental Services Offices,
                            District Developmental Services Offices, due process for community
                            placements, and family care.</p>

          <p>The series consists of correspondence, reports, and other materials relating
                        to the implementation of the Willowbrook Consent Decree by the New York
                        State Department of Mental Hygiene (known as the 'Office of Mental
                        Retardation and Developmental Disabilities' from 1978 to the present). The
                        papers are arranged alphabetically, some by topic (e.g., Community
                        Residential Facilities, Hepatitis B Carriers), others by office of origin
                        (e.g., Office of Counsel); in most cases these reflect the original
                        record-keeping system. The two largest groups of materials in the series
                        are: Commissioner's Correspondence which includes correspondence to and from
                        the four men who held the office of DMH/OMRDD commissioner from 1975 to
                        1981; and Technical Assistance Unit/Consent Decree Office which includes
                        materials by and about the specific office of the DMH/OMRDD charged with
                        implementing the Consent Decree. The series is restricted because it
                        contains information about specific named residents of Willowbrook and other
                        state developmental centers. Most of the material in this series is in
                        letter-sized format. The last box contains legal-sized material in a
                        separate alphabetical arrangement.</p>

            <p>Willowbrook Developmental Center was formerly known as the Willowbrook
                            State School. In 1979 its name was changed to Staten Island
                            Developmental Center, but some still referred to it as Willowbrook. The
                            name Willowbrook Developmental Center has been used for all folder
                            titles.</p>
            <p>Files in this subseries document the day-to-day operation of Willowbrook
                            Developmental Center. Topics of particular interest include staff
                            training, medical care, dental services, nursing services, education of
                            residents, policies and procedures, and incident reports, There are also
                            files of correspondence from Willowbrook directors. Also included in
                            this subseries are files related to the buildings at Willowbrook managed
                            by United Cerebral Palsy. Many files contain records of individual
                            Willowbrook patients.</p>
            <p>This subseries consists of both letter and legal sized files in separate
                            alphabetical arrangements. At the end of the subseries are four flat
                            boxes, which contain an oversized computer printout listing the status
                            history of Willowbrook residents and a printout listing Willowbrook
                            residents receiving psychoactive medications.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains the Review Panel's files on state developmental
                            centers other than Willowbrook. Many of the centers housed members of
                            the Willowbrook Class. Developmental centers represented in this series
                            include Manhattan Developmental Center, Bronx Developmental Center,
                            Bernard Fineson Developmental Center, Suffolk Developmental Center,
                            Westchester Developmental Center, and Wassaic Developmental Center. The
                            level of documentation present varies considerably from facility to
                            facility. Facility files contain records such as policy manuals,
                            correspondence, budgets, case management files, and staff training
                            materials. This subseries consists of both letter and legal sized files
                            in separate alphabetical arrangements.</p>

          <p>This series consists of audits and evaluations, building plans,
                        correspondence, reports, and other materials regarding Willowbrook Class
                        Members residing in the Mental Retardation Institute of the Flower Fifth
                        Avenue Hospital (also identified as "Flower/Fifth Hospital", "Flower and
                        Fifth Hospital", "Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital", and "Flower and Fifth
                        Avenue Hospitals") from 1977 to 1981. The papers document disagreements
                        between the Willowbrook Review Panel and DMH/OMRDD over the suitability of
                        Flower Fifth as a residence for Class Members, and the efforts of the
                        hospital to become compliant with the standards of the Consent Decree.
                        Information on specific named patients is found throughout this series. The
                        series is restricted because it contains information about specific named
                        patients at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital. The materials are arranged
                        alphabetically and include one cubic foot of legal-size papers in their own
                        alphabetical arrangement.</p>

          <p>This series consists of files on various topics relating to Willowbrook, such
                        as consumer groups, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded,
                        New York State government agencies involved in the case, similar court
                        cases, and other subject matter. The series is restricted because many
                        folders contain information on specific named residents of Willowbrook and
                        other state developmental centers. Subjects of note include advisory boards,
                        case management, community agencies, consumer groups, intermediate care
                        facilities, New York State agencies, staff development, and toilet training.
                        The files are in both letter-size and legal-size formats and are in separate
                        alphabetical arrangements.</p>

          <p>This series consists of 2.5 cubic feet of files related to complaints and
                        inquiries received and investigated by the Willowbrook Review Panel. Many of
                        these complaints came from parents or guardians of Willowbrook class
                        members, expressing concern about conditions at facilities or in community
                        placements. Other complaints came from facility employees, claiming that
                        they had observed disregard for the mandates of the Consent Decree while on
                        the job. There are also records of general inquiries about the Review Panel
                        and the Consent Decree from students, the news media, and others.</p>
          <p>Most of the material is organized chronologically, with each month's folder
                        containing a summary of complaints and inquiries as well as supporting
                        documents, mostly correspondence. However, there are also a few files for
                        individual facilities. There is extensive documentation of the case of
                        Sharon Solnica, including many transcripts from Board of Education hearings.
                        Sharon's parents sought to have her educated at the Institute for Applied
                        Human Dynamics while in residence at the Bernard Fineson Developmental
                        Center (BFDC). Fineson staff members argued that the hour-long bus ride from
                        BFDC to the Institute was detrimental to Sharon's progress. Also included in
                        this series are files related to a complaint made by a Willowbrook staff
                        member, Pricilla Sarino, to the Review Panel. Sarino provided the Panel with
                        several hundred pages of Willowbrook internal memoranda and other documents
                        to support her complaint. The series is restricted because it contains
                        information about specific named residents of Willowbrook and other state
                        developmental centers.</p>

          <p>This series contains the New York Civil Liberties Union's files related to
                        Willowbrook and the Consent Decree. It consists of court papers from
                        primarily NYSARC and Parisi v. Rockefeller/Carey (United States District
                        Court-Eastern District of New York, No. 72-C-356/357), the lawsuit filed by
                        the New York State Association for Retarded Children and the parents or
                        representatives of several Willowbrook Class members against New York State
                        in the wake of Geraldo Rivera's TV news story. The materials are arranged
                        chronologically, and may be divided into two periods: the pre-Consent Decree
                        phase, 1973-1975 and the post-Consent Decree phase, 1977-1981.</p>
          <p>The pre-Consent Decree materials (only four folders) contain documents
                        relating to Judge Judd's 1973 ruling on the Willowbrook Class members'
                        constitutional right to freedom from harm, as well as a copy of the 1975
                        Consent Decree in which New York State agreed to a new set of standards of
                        care for the Willowbrook Class members, and to place most class members into
                        the community.</p>
          <p>The post-Consent Decree materials are the various lawsuits arising from
                        disagreements between the WRP and the state over how to implement the
                        provisions of the Consent Decree, either because the state found itself
                        falling behind schedule or because the WRP issued recommendations the state
                        regarded as unworkable. The first of these led to the March 10, 1977
                        Stipulation and Order on Consent, which dictated a timetable for placing
                        Willowbrook Class members into the community, outlined the number and kinds
                        of staff needed to carry out the community placement timetable, and ordered
                        New York State to enter into contract with United Cerebral Palsy to have UCP
                        run several buildings at Willowbrook. The ruling itself became the basis of
                        subsequent litigation, as the Civil Service Employees Association sued the
                        state on the grounds that the UCP contract violated collective bargaining
                        agreements. Disagreements over the staffing of another body created by the
                        Consent Decree, the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), was also the basis for
                        litigation. District Court rulings were sometimes appealed to the United
                        States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and one reached the United
                        States Supreme Court.</p>
          <p>The series also contains several audits and reports issued by the Willowbrook
                        Review Panel in a chronological arrangement of their own.</p>
