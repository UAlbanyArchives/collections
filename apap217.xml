      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Ronald B. Stafford was born in Plattsburgh, NY, on June 29, 1935. He was the adopted child
        of Agnes and Halsey Stafford, a grade-school teacher and a state prison worker, and was
        raised in Dannemora, NY. After graduating from Plattsburgh High School, Stafford earned a
        B.A. in government from St. Lawrence University in 1957. He served in the U.S. Army as an
        intelligence officer and earned his J.D. from Columbia School of Law in 1962. He was the
        first St. Lawrence graduate to be awarded an Edward John Noble Fellowship.</p>
      <p>Initially selected by local Republican leaders to run in a special election in 1965,
        Stafford won his first election to the New York State Senate in 1966. He represented the
        45th Senate District in New York State's North Country, which eventually came to include
        Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Warren, and Washington Counties. Stafford continued to
        serve the 45th district as State Senator until his retirement in 2002. During his 37-year
        tenure, Stafford served as Deputy Majority leader for Legislature Operations and as Chairman
        of several committees including the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Committee on Codes, the
        Senate Higher Education Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee. While Chairman of the
        Higher Education Committee in 1974, Stafford helped establish New York State’s Tuition
        Assistance Program (TAP) which provides need-based assistance to many undergraduate students
        who would otherwise be financially unable to attend college</p>
      <p>Senator Stafford was instrumental in bringing the Winter Olympic Games to Lake Placid in
        1980, having been appointed Chairman of the New York State 1980 Olympic Winter Games
        Commission in 1974. He is also noted for his support for the "Toxic Torts Bill," passed in
        1986, which expanded legal protection to people exposed to toxic chemicals; Stafford opposed
        his fellow Republicans during the five-year battle to pass this bill.</p>
      <p>As his district included a significant portion of the Adirondack Park, much of his
        attention was spent representing the needs of the Park and its residents. Governor George
        Pataki recognized Senator Stafford “for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the people of the
        Park” in his keynote address at the Adirondack Park Agency’s 30th Anniversary in 2003.</p>
      <p>Stafford served on several boards during his career, including the Boards of Trustees of
        the College of St. Rose and St. Lawrence University and the Boards of Directors of the
        Champlain Valley School of Nursing and the Adirondack Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
        After his retirement, Governor Pataki appointed him to the Board of Trustees for the State
        University of New York. Senator Stafford’s family included his wife, the former Kay McCabe,
        two sons, a daughter, a stepson, a stepdaughter, and four stepgrandchildren. He died on June
        24, 2005, after battling lung cancer.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Ronald B. Stafford Papers document Stafford's service as a New York State Senator
        representing the 45th District. The collection represents the wide range of activities in
        which Stafford engaged during his 37-year tenure in the State Senate. Stafford's legislative
        activities are represented by a large amount of material on legislation which he sponsored,
        co-sponsored and supported. His work on behalf of his North Country constituents is
        represented by documentation of the casework in which his office solved constituents'
        problems and by letters of support for grant applications. Appointment books and telephone
        message pads document Senator Stafford's day-to-day activities, and his public
        accomplishments are recorded in news clippings and press releases. His activities as
        representative of the Adirondack region are described in series on the Adirondack Park
        Agency and the Lake Placid Olympics. Senator Stafford's career is further documented by
        photographs, memorabilia and physical artifacts acquired during his long service in the
        State Senate.</p>

          <p>The files in this series pertain to the creation and work of the Adirondack Park Agency
            (APA) and to the various political groups and legislative bills which supported or
            opposed the creation of the Agency. The series includes publications by the APA and
            other groups, legislative files, correspondence, maps, memoranda, and news clippings.
            The bulk of the series covers the years 1967-1978 and 1990-1997, with some materials
            dating from 1956-2002. Legislation pertaining to
            the Adirondack Park Agency can also be found in Series 9 of this collection.</p>

          <p>This series contains material related to the various commissions and committees created
            to prepare for and host the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Such groups
            include the Lake Placid Olympic Bid Committee, the Temporary State XIII Olympic Winter
            Games Commission, and the New York State 1980 Lake Placid Olympic Winter Games
            Commission. Materials represented include reports, correspondence, appointments,
            memoranda, minutes, finances, and clippings. Where the original order identifies the
            specific committee responsible for a record, this order has been maintained. Many
            folders, however, contain papers involving the records of more than one committee, and
            sometimes the specific committee responsible for a record cannot be identified. In these
            cases, folders are identified with the generic title of “Olympic Winter Games
            Commissions.” In addition, the heading “Olympic Organizing Committee” designates records
            pertaining to the Lake Placid’s 1980 Olympic Winter Games Organizing Committee and its
            subcommittees, which include Transportation, Security and Public Affairs. This series
            contains materials used for Lake Plaid's Olympic bid. Proposals and agreements with
            architects and contractors can also be found in this series as well as Olympic pins, programs,
            tickets, and employment information.</p>

          <p>This series contains records related to problem-solving activity on behalf of Senator
            Stafford's constituents. Each year, Senator Stafford's office received numerous letters
            from constituents asking for help with various problems. A typical case file consists of
            the constituent's letter, attached supporting material, and notes on the action taken to
            resolve the problem. The casework for each year is typically grouped under the file name
            General Casework with larger cases belonging in their own, separate folder. Cases are
            arranged chronologically by year.</p>

          <p>This series contains daily appointment books which document Senator Stafford's
            activities. Each annual hardbound book contains detailed entries on Senator Stafford's
            day-to-day engagements. There are also files containing loose appointment books pages,
            some dated and others not. A majority of loose pages can be found in a separate folder
            according to the year they are from. The volumes are organized chronologically.</p>

            Stafford's office changed the way it organized his correspondence. Subseries 2
            reflects this change in organization. The researcher should also note that the files in
            Subseries 2 are arranged according to specific dates. It is possible that the
            switch came about when the Senator's staff switched to a new computerized form letter
            system that stored letters chronologically by their date of creation.</p>

          <p>This series contains files on legislation of which Senator Ronald Stafford was a sponsor,
            co-sponsor or supporter. Files typically contain a final print of the bill and may
            contain drafts and previous versions, supporting material, and other material records to
            the bill. A majority of the files contain a copy of the final bill and a memorandum of
            support. Bills that faced public debate are in larger files, containing letters of support,
            letters of opposition, correspondence, and multiple drafts. A pattern can be seen within
            the legislation files pertaining to the issues Senator Stafford cared about. The same
            bill can be seen throughout multiple years, slightly changing in hopes to have it
            passed. The bill eventually stops appearing, signifying that it was either passed, or
            Senator Stafford decided not to pursue it again. The researcher should note that the full name of the bill is used as the file name from approximately 1974-1980. After that, the files are named in accordance with Stafford's naming scheme by the main theme or topic of
            the legislative bill. These themes and topics include the following: the Adirondack Park
            Agency, Fishing and Hunting Licenses, Environmental Issues, Retirement Membership and
            Services, and Higher Education. This series also contains legislative resolutions that
            Senator Stafford either introduced or supported. These were often to honor,
            memorialize, or congratulate people or events. Files are organized chronologically.</p>

          <p>This series contains a large amount of photographs taken during Senator Ronald Stafford's time
            in office. Senator Stafford can be seen with school groups, organizations such as 4-H,
            and other legislators. Some files also contain the letter sent along with the
            photographs. This
            series contains photographs of identified groups or individuals as well as
            unidentified ones. Photographs of identifiable events were each given their own folders. Headshots of Senator Stafford and negatives of photographs are also
            included.</p>
