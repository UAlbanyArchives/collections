      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Dr. Howard F. "Red" Miller was born on August 18, 1920 in Buffalo, NY. He graduated Syracuse University in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Journalism where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.</p>
      <p>At the start of World War II, he entered the United States Army as a private. During the course of the war, he rose to the rank of 1st Lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. He served in the United States and the European theater of operations. He was wounded in action and awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for bravery.</p>
      <p>After being honorably discharged from the Army in 1945 he attended Harvard University, earning a master's degree in Public Administration in 1947 and a doctorate in Government in 1955. From 1947 to 1969 he was on the faculty of the Maxwell School of Public Affairs at Syracuse University. From 1948 to 1955 he served as the administrative assistant to the Dean of the Maxwell Graduate School. In the summer of 1952 he worked as a research consultant to the Department of the Army in preparation for an Army Comptroller program at Syracuse University.</p>
      <p>In 1956 Syracuse University granted Miller teaching leave to serve as an administrative deputy to the New York State (NYS) Division of the Budget. He held that position until 1959 when he became a consultant to the NYS Department of Audit and Control to coordinate and write the Annual Report of the State Comptroller. From 1962 to 1965 he acted as the fiscal advisor to the Minority Leader of the NYS Assembly, Representative Anthony Travia. Miller became secretary of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee in 1965 and served as such till 1968. In this capacity he participated in the NYS Constitutional Convention of 1967.</p>
      <p>From 1968 through June of 1981 Miller served in various appointed NYS government posts; executive director of the NYS Social Development Planning Commission, 1968 to 1971, deputy director of the NYS Division of the Budget, 1971 to 1977, and director of the NYS Division of the Budget in 1978, a position directly appointed by Governor Hugh L. Carey. In 1971, continuing into 1972, he took leave from the Division of the Budget to serve as executive director of the Scott Commission, created to study government operations in New York City.</p>
      <p>For his government service, Syracuse University presented Miller with the George Arents Award for excellence in government in 1973. He was further honored in 1982, receiving the Nelson A. Rockefeller Award for distinguished public service.</p>
      <p>Miller resigned from public service for health reasons in June 1981. He lived in Delmar, NY until his death on February 17, 1999. He was survived by his wife Peg and two sons.</p>

          <p>This series contains Dr. Miller's personal papers in regards to the Constitutional Convention of 1967. Important papers included are summaries of legislations, legislative reports, newspaper clippings, correspondence and reports relating to finance for the New York State Constitutional Convention.</p>
          <p>The Constitutional Convention of 1967 was the ninth such convention in New York State history. The purpose of the Convention was to eliminate obsolete and confusing provisions and remove unnecessary detail from the extremely lengthy document. New Yorkers ultimately rejected the proposed changes to the Constitution in the 1967 election.</p>
          <p>Series 2 begins with Folder 24 in Box 2. There are two bound volumes that are housed within Special Collections, but outside of this collection, pertaining to the New York State Constitutional Convention. See also Summary of Legislation 1966 Packet 1 in Series 3 for related Constitutional Convention information.</p>
