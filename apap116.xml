      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Norman Studer, educator, folklorist, author, was born in Whitehouse, Ohio on September 7,
        1902. In 1917, Studer left home, enlisted in the United States Navy, and served as a
        quartermaster aboard the U.S.S. Edgecomb. Upon the conclusion of World War I, Studer
        returned home to complete his high school education, whereupon he matriculated to Oberlin
        College. Studer spent three years at Oberlin, leaving after his third year to become an
        editor of <emph render="italic">The New Student</emph> – a newspaper for "the voice of the
        student revolt movement" in New York City. Studer eventually returned to college completing
        his A.B. in History at Columbia University in 1929. He continued his studies at Columbia,
        earning an A.M in Political Science in 1931.</p>
      <p>In 1931 Studer embarked upon a forty-year career in education, commencing with a teaching
        assignment at Erie Day School in Erie, Pennsylvania. Following two years at Erie, Studer
        taught at the Little Red School House, a cooperative, experimental school founded by
        Elisabeth Irwin, located in lower Manhattan. Studer was attracted to the experimental and
        progressive curriculum cultivated by Irwin and the other educators at the Little Red School
        House. In 1941, Studer chaired the committee founding the Elisabeth Irwin High School, and
        worked there as both teacher and administrator for the following ten years.</p>
      <p>Studer's association with Elisabeth Irwin proved influential in shaping his pedagogical
        vision, both in the classroom and beyond. While at the Little Red School House, Studer
        developed and taught a unit entitled "Slavery and the Negro Problem" that led to a life long
        interest in ethnic studies and "intergroup relations," the equivalent of the current study
        of multiculturalism or multicultural studies. It was also during his tenure at the Little
        Red School House that Studer realized the importance of field trips as an integral component
        of the curricular experience. Through field trips, Studer discovered that he could inform
        his students, in a more immediate and kinesthetic sense, of the rich history and heritage
        that lay just beyond the school walls. As a teacher, Studer also participated in "June Camp"
        – a one- month field trip to Camp Quannacut, near Pine Bush, New York – in which students
        lived in a democratic community within a rural environment. Studer ran June Camp from
        1936-1940.</p>
      <p>In 1938, Studer joined the staff of Camp Hilltop - a progressive educational summer camp -
        initially as head counselor and then as director of education. Camp Hilltop closed in 1940;
        however, Studer, along with Camp Hilltop's former director, Rose Sydney, and three others,
        Regine Dicker (Ferber), Sara Abelson (Abramson), and Studer's wife Hannah, founded Camp
        Woodland in Phoenicia, New York, located in the heart of the Catskill Mountains. Camp
        Woodland strove to create a democratic environment where children of varying religions,
        socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds from the New York City area could steep in the rich
        ecology of the Catskill region for two months each summer.</p>
      <p>The curriculum and experience of Camp Woodland were deeply rooted in the folklore and folk
        culture of the Catskill Mountains. Norman Cazden and Herb Haufrecht were Camp Woodland's
        music directors. Studer attempted to incorporate the endemic culture, history, and rituals
        of the Catskill region into the Camp Woodland curriculum by cultivating a symbiotic
        relationship with the camp and the Catskill denizens. He would often take carloads of
        campers to visit the local residents, then invite the residents back to camp to share their
        regional folklore and music, as well as teach the traditional crafts of the region. The
        two-month summer camp concluded each season with a folk festival that brought together the
        campers and Catskill residents for a weekend of music, drama, dancing, story telling, and
        song. The annual Folk Festival of the Catskills was the high point of each season and became
        very popular with the campers, folk musicians, and local residents. The annual event
        attracted luminary musicians such as Pete Seeger, Bessie Jones, Norman Cazden, and Herb
        Haufrecht as well as local talent that included Grant Rogers, Harry Siemsen, George Edwards,
        Ernie Sagan, George Van Kleeck, and Etson Van Wagner. Studer captured the folk festivals on
        tape, and in many instances the recordings remain the only known extant audio recordings of
        these local musicians playing and singing the ballads and songs of the Catskills. These
        recordings were later compiled, transcribed, and edited by Cazden, Haufrecht, and Studer in
        a book entitled <emph render="italic">Folk Songs of the Catskills</emph>. Studer was
        director of Camp Woodland from its inception (1940) to dissolution (1962). </p>
      <p>In 1951, Studer became director of the Downtown Community School located at 235 East 11th
        Street in lower Manhattan. The Downtown Community School was a progressive, cooperative,
        racially integrated school, founded in 1944 by a group of parents and educators. As
        director, Studer attempted to create a curriculum that was aimed at promoting a healthy
        concept of self and a deeper understanding of society. Studer brought many of the ideas and
        philosophies of the Little Red School House, Elisabeth Irwin High School, and Camp Woodland
        to the Downtown Community School, particularly his interest in ethnic studies, folklore,
        field trips, and racial integration. Throughout his career as an educator and administrator,
        Studer championed cultural and racial integration in the educational environment. In 1956,
        the annual Conference on Intergroup Education – a forum for educators, parents, and
        community members designed to encourage inter-racial and inter-cultural education – was
        founded. Studer's approach to the education of children was always direct, active, and
        personal. He exemplified this by continuing to sponsor and steward annual field trips for
        the seventh and eighth grade students throughout his tenure at the Downtown Community
        School. Studer remained director of the Downtown Community School until 1970. The school
        closed in 1971.</p>
      <p>Studer was the author of numerous articles, two books, and one poem, nearly all of which
        dealt with the themes of folklore and education. <emph render="italic">Folk Songs of the
          Catskills</emph>, edited by Norman Cazden, Herbert Haufrecht, and Norman Studer, published
        by SUNY Albany Press in 1982, "is an annotated volume of traditional ballads and songs
        collected under the auspices of Camp Woodland." Cazden, Haufrecht and Studer assiduously
        compiled, recorded, transcribed, and edited the songs and music over the course of forty-two
        years. Both Cazden and Studer passed away prior to its publication, leaving Haufrecht to see
        the project through to completion. The folk culture of the Catskill region was predominately
        transmitted orally; therefore, <emph render="italic">Folk Songs of the Catskills</emph> has
        to be considered the definitive treatment of Catskill folk music, as many of the informants
        have passed away. Also published posthumously, <emph render="italic">A Catskill Bear Hunter:
          Mike Todd's Story</emph> by Purple Mountain Press in 1988, is Studer's "folk biography" of
        Mike Todd, a Catskill native and good friend of Studer's, who spent numerous summers at Camp
        Woodland; he also serves as the subject of Studer's poem "All the Homespun Days," written in
        his memory.</p>
      <p>Norman Studer died October 27, 1978. His wife Hannah and daughter Joan Studer Levine
        survived him. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>The Norman Studer Papers document his career as both an educator and ardent Catskill
        folklorist. The papers are particularly robust in documenting his administrative activities
        as director of both the Downtown Community School (1951-1970) and Camp Woodland (1940-1962).
        The strength of the collections lies in the discrete and manifold formats documenting two
        essential themes: progressive education and the folklore and culture of the Catskills.
        Materials include unpublished manuscripts, manuscript drafts, typescripts, reprints, notes,
        correspondence, diaries, student writings, litigation, news clippings, audio recordings, 8mm
        and 16mm films, and photographs. The papers contain an extraordinary collection of
        reel-to-reel audiotapes capturing local Catskill informant interviews, a wide array of
        regional and national folk singers performing, folk festivals, and educational activities at
        the Downtown Community School. There is also a substantial collection of photographs
        documenting the people and activities at the Downtown Community School and Camp Woodland.
        There are a number of photographs of notable local and national folk personalities,
        including George Edwards, Herbert Haufrecht, Norman Cazden, Grant Rogers, Harry Siemsen, and
        Pete Seeger. A small number of images are available for viewing online from the University
        at Albany Libraries' Digital Collections database.</p>
      <p>The collection contains nearly all of Studer's published and unpublished writings. Studer's
        writings generally address the issues of regional folklore and how to assimilate folklore
        into curriculum – <emph render="italic">Community Life</emph> and <emph render="italic">Woodland Story</emph>, two unpublished manuscripts exemplify this synthesis. There are a
        number of diaries and travelogues in the writing series; however, they are generally
        ephemeral and unrevealing as a result of their terse and sporadic nature.</p>
      <p>Although there is sparse documentation of Studer's teaching activities in the collection,
        there are a few significant examples, such as the material related to African American
        studies at the Little Red School House and the Downtown Community School. It appears that
        Studer was an early advocate of incorporating African American studies into his curriculum.
        As director of the Downtown Community School and Camp Woodland, he sought to cultivate and
        nurture equal opportunity enrollment. In addition to the African American studies material,
        there is substantial material related to the field trip units Studer developed.</p>

          <p>This series contains Norman Studer's curriculum vitae, a partial autobiography, a brief
            biography, memorial tributes, family photographs, family records, and correspondence.
            The correspondence has been identified by correspondent's name only when the volume or
            significance warrants such separation; however, the bulk of the correspondence is
            arranged chronologically. Notable correspondents include Pete and Toshi Seeger and David
            Dunaway, Seeger's biographer as well as a former Camp Woodland camper.</p>
          <p>This series also includes materials related to Norman Studer's daughter Joan Studer
            Levine, including her writings, graduation commencement program and relevant
            correspondence from the 1980s through 2001. Levine also collected records related to
            Studer family reunions and genealogy. </p>

          <p>Norman Studer was an educator and administrator at the Little Red School House and
            Elisabeth Irwin High School from the early 1930s until 1951. There is a relatively
            insignificant amount of material related to Studer's teaching activities, with the
            exception of a folder entitled "Slavery and the Negro Problem." The folder contains
            notes, bibliographies, and analyses of an educational unit Studer developed addressing
            the historical and cultural position of the "American Negro" in the late 1930s and early
            1940s. The material documents Studer's early interest in the concept of American
            democracy and interracial relations, as well as his collaborative approach to the
            subject, which includes portions of student interviews revealing their attitudes toward
            African Americans, the Civil War and slavery. Also of interest is the folder entitled
              <emph render="italic">Our Voice</emph>, containing several copies of a student run
            publication featuring articles, prose, drama, poetry, and opinions of students at the
            Little Red School House.</p>

          <p>Norman Studer served as the Director of the Downtown Community School from 1951 until
            April 1970. His daughter Joan Levine also taught at the school until 1970. This series
            is divided into Administration and Activities subseries.</p>

            <p>The Administration subseries documents Norman Studer's day-to-day activities as the
              Director of the Downtown Community School. Included are Board of Trustee meeting
              minutes, a copy of the Downtown Community School by-laws, core curriculum notes,
              teacher's guides, admissions policy reports, correspondence to parents and staff
              members, and material related to interracial and intercultural education. In 1963,
              Studer invited a group of African American parents boycotting a segregated school in
              Engelwood, NJ to bring their 31 children to a Freedom School at the Downtown Community
              School so the children could continue their education durign the struggle.</p>
            <p>There are a number of folders related to the abrupt resignation of the long-time
              director of the Downtown Community School Nursery School, Irene Neurath, at the
              conclusion of the 1967-1968 academic year. The resignation shocked the administration,
              Board of Trustees, as well as the parents. Two years later (April 1970), the Board of
              Trustees asked for Studer's resignation. One year later, the school closed. There is a
              significant amount of material related to Studer's final years at the Downtown
              Community School.</p>

            <p>The Activities subseries contains material produced by or involving the students of
              the Downtown Community School, as well as Norman Studer, beyond his administrative
              responsibilities. Materials include notes from field trips, graduation dramas, student
              writings, and Downtown Community School publications, the <emph render="italic">Downtowner</emph> and <emph render="italic">Scribbler</emph>. The <emph render="italic">Downtowner</emph> was an internally published periodical containing
              a calendar of events, an editorial from Studer, announcements, and student writings.
              The <emph render="italic">Scribbler</emph> differed in that it was solely composed of
              student writings from each grade level. This subseries is particularly strong in its
              representation of field trips sponsored by Studer, many of which were taken to the
              Catskill Mountains. The folders often include itineraries, curricular guides, local
              history and maps, as well as student reflections and drawings. Many of the Downtown
              Community School graduation dramas were predicated on the field trip experiences. Also
              of interest are a number of folders containing general student writings and drawings
              and a file on the successful 1965 efforts by the children to help save the historic
              Old Merchant's House in New York City from demolition. </p>

          <p>Norman Studer, Rose Sydney, Regine Dicker (Ferber), Sara Abelson (Abramson), and Hannah
            Studer, founded Camp Woodland in Phoenicia, New York in 1940. Norman Studer served as
            camp director until 1962. A 1963 fire destroyed the camp buildings. </p>
          <p>This series is divided into three subseries - Administration, Activities, and
            Post-Camp.</p>

            <p>The Administration subseries documents the functions of the director, Board of
              Trustees, and staff of Camp Woodland as they relate to the operation of the Camp.
              Materials include annual reports, meeting minutes, correspondence, litigation,
              counselor in training handbooks, as well as documents related to the Larkin Committee
              and an investigation of Norman Studer and Camp Woodland for possible subversive
              activities and ties to the Communist Party. The annual reports provide fiscal summary
              data related to the operation of the Camp, including, but not limited to, tuition
              costs, expenditures, operating costs, tax liability, fixed assets and accumulated
              depreciation, and accumulated funds. These reports were prepared by certified public
              accountants and record the fiscal state of Camp Woodland in great detail. The folder
              entitled "Board of Director's Dispute" documents an effort by three of Camp Woodland's
              founders and Board members - Mrs. Ferber, Mrs. Sydney, and Mrs. Abramson - to separate
              themselves, legally and financially, from the Camp. It is unclear what precipitated
              the dispute, but ultimately, it appears there were philosophical differences as well
              as divergent financial interests.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest are the folders pertaining to the Larkin Committee's
              investigation of Norman Studer and Camp Woodland as having sympathetic ties with the
              Communist Party. During the early months of 1955, the Joint Legislative Committee on
              Charitable and Philanthropic Agencies and Organizations of New York (also known as the
              Larkin Committee after Committee Head State Senator Edward Larkin) investigated the
              possibility of subversive training and indoctrination of children in
              Communist-established summer camps. In the report, Studer was specifically "identified
              as a long-time member of the Communist Party." Studer was also accused of having
              "purposely hired Communists as his assistants at the camp." One of the possible
              assistants being alluded to may have been Pete Seeger, who is also identified in this
              report as being "Pro-Communist." Studer testified before the Committee in August 1955;
              however, formal charges were never filed against Studer nor Camp Woodland. When
              testifying, Studer invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Communist Party
              membership, answered other questions and read a prepared statement. The files include
              Studer's statement, subpoena, related correspondence (including hate mail sent to
              Studer), newsclippings, and Committee resolutions and a final report.</p>
            <p>There also are a small number of documents related to Camp Hilltop where Norman
              Studer served as director of education before helping to found Camp Woodland.</p>

            <p>The Activities subseries consists primarily of publications, event announcements,
              writings, and art produced by campers, or counselors of Camp Woodland. Notable
              materials include copies of the Camp magazine, <emph render="italic">Neighbors</emph>;
              programs, announcements, news clippings, and correspondence related to the Folk
              Festival of the Catskills; ephemeral publications; and various creative writings.
              There also are materials about the Folk Museum.</p>
            <p>The publication <emph render="italic">Neighbors</emph> was originally published as
              the Folk Festival of the Catskills program, but eventually became a separate
              publication in 1944 and continued until 1962. It evolved into an annual magazine
              devoted to recording the explorations and discoveries of campers and camp counselors
              each summer. Please note that the Studer Papers do not have a complete run of <emph render="italic">Neighbors</emph>. Noted musician and composer, Norman Cazden, and
              occasionally Herbert Haufrecht, supervised the folk music contributions of <emph render="italic">Neighbors</emph>; as a result, it became a rich source of sheet
              music and lyrics for regional folksongs.</p>
            <p>Camp Woodland culminated each year with the annual Folk Festival of the Catskills.
              Studer invited many of the local fiddlers, musicians, dance callers, and ballad
              singers to join the campers in a folk festival performance for the counselors,
              community members, and parents. Studer organized the folk festival with the manifold
              purpose of reviving the Catskill heritage of folk music and dance. Pete Seeger
              periodically performed at the Folk Festival of the Catskills, particularly during the
              early years. Many of the festivals were recorded by Studer, and are located in Series
              6: Audio Recordings and Series 7: Films. Please note that the Folk Festival of the
              Catskills files have different types and amounts of materials depending upon the year.
              Some simply have programs or a list of events. Others have this, but also feature
              extensive planning records, newspaper clips, analysis and speeches.</p>
            <p>The Folk Museum of the Catskills began with a small collection of tools representing
              folk life in the region. These were held at Camp Woodland, but the museum sought a
              more permanent home during the next two decades. The museum was first housed in the
              Butterfly House at Camp, then in a home on Main Street in Phoenicia, and later at the
              Ski House at Simpson Ski Slope. In 1957 campers began clearing land and a site at the
              Camp for a new museum structure. The Museum was dedicated during the 1962 Folk
              Festival of the Catskills. After Camp Woodland closed, Studer relocated the materials
              to a museum at the Downtown Community School and eventually these tools were donated
              to other museums and repositories. Several tools are now held at the M.E. Grenander
              Department of Special Collections and Archives. Please see the Folk Festival of the
              Catskills files for additional content on the museum.</p>

            <p>This small subseries contains materials documenting Camp Woodland related activities
              and events which occurred after the camp closed. This includes reunions and the
              creation of <emph render="italic">The Woodland Sampler</emph>, a compilation of
              Catskill folk music played at Camp Woodland, including some recordings from the annual
              Folk Festival of the Catskills. Norman Studer embarked on the <emph render="italic">The Woodland Sampler</emph> project in 1977, a year before his death, and it was
              continued by his family, including daughter Joan Studer Levine and grandson Eric
              Levine. The Levines published a cassette and an accompanying booklet detailing the
              songs, poetry and music on the tape in 1987.</p>

          <p>Unless noted, this series contains photographs and postcards taken, collected by or
            featuring Norman Studer. There are images from the Little Red School House, Elisabeth
            Irwin High School, Downtown Community School, Camp Woodland, family trips out-of-state,
            and various New York locations. While archivists, Studer family members and former
            students and campers have made identifications where possible, the majority of the
            photographs contain unidentified individuals or events and are undated. </p>

              and George Edwards, Harry Robinson, Grant Rogers, Ernie Sagan, Harry Siemsen, Orson
              Slack, and George Van Kleeck. There are a number of photographs of Norman Cazden and
              Herbert Haufrecht, both of whom served as musical directors for the camp, photographs
              of Norman Studer, as well as photographs of Pete Seeger playing his banjo. There is a
              file of photographs of Camp Hilltop as well.</p>
            <p>Former camper Joan Simon Faulkner also donated digitized versions of many of her
              black and white and color photographs from Camp Woodland from 1954, 1960, and 1962 and
              of the 1958 Folk Festival of the Catskills. Please contact the Department to access

            <p>The Downtown Community School audio recordings document guest speakers, student
              discussions and readings, school plays, intergroup conferences, lectures, staff
              meetings, musical performances, school trips, oral histories and other programs.
              Highlights of the subseries include recordings about race relations and the boycott
              that took place at the Lincoln School in Englewood, NJ in February 1963 and a visit to
              the school from Red Thunder Cloud, last native speaker of the Catawba Indian language.

            <p>The Camp Woodland audio recordings may be one of the more significant components of
              the collection. While at Camp Woodland, Norman Studer recorded numerous oral histories
              of many of the indigenous Catskill residents as well as the annual Folk Festival of
              the Catskills. Studer was acutely aware that he was in a position to capture the
              ethnographic folk culture, music, and ecology of a fading era. In many instances, the
              tapes represent the only extant recordings and variations of a number of songs.</p>
            <p>Highlights of the Camp Woodland audio recordings include Pete Seeger and Bessie Jones
              performing at the Folk Festival of the Catskills and at Camp Woodland.

              Robert circa Gregory (old man), Ralph Vanderlip (boy), Grant Rodgers (fiddler), Walter
              L. Terry (judge), David and Herta Marshall (singers), the people of Cannonsville,
              Delhi, Deposit, Granton, Rock Rift, Walton, West Branch, Delaware River, State of New
              York.</p>
            <p> On the first hot day of summer, an old farmer goes fishing just as he has done for
              many years on the West Branch of the Delaware River. A young boy, his frequent fishing
              companion, eagerly takes him to see the first giant bulldozers, which are to begin
              construction on the Cannonsville Reservoir. In order to provide more water for the
              cities, the vast project will flood the valley. The old man goes to the general store
              and walks the length of the valley to talk about his concerns, but most people do not
              support him. The young people of the valley celebrate at a barn dance. The old man
              resists eviction with his unloaded flintlock. The next day, he watches as the houses
              and farms are burned to clear the way. </p>

            <p>This subseries contains manuscript and typescript drafts, typescripts, notes,
              reprints, monographs, and a small amount of correspondence related to Studer's writing
              projects. Of interest are two typescript drafts of unpublished projects: <emph render="italic">Community Life</emph> and <emph render="italic">Woodland
                Story</emph> both of which are reflective pieces examining Studer's life and work at
              the Downtown Community School and Camp Woodland respectively. Please note that Studer
              published some <emph render="italic">Woodland Story</emph> chapters separately. For
              instance, "Folklore from a Valley that Died" (Chapter 9) was a standalone article in
                <emph render="italic">New York Folklore Quarterly</emph> in 1956. The standalone
              article "Yarns of a Catskill Woodsman" (Chapter 16) appeared in <emph render="italic">New York Folklore Quarterly</emph> in 1955. "Mike Todd's Story" (Chapter 11) later
              evolved into and was published as <emph render="italic">A Catskill Woodsman</emph>. A
              draft of <emph render="italic">Woodland Story</emph>'s Chapter 17 entitled "Our
              Catskill Teachers" also appears as a section of a draft of Chapter 3. Therefore draft
              text is found in both files. This collection is missing later draft chapters of <emph render="italic">Woodland Story</emph> so there are gaps in the order.</p>
            <p>Many of the unpublished writings in this series reflect Studer's interest in the folk
              culture of the Catskills, such as "Action on Dingle Hill," "Forgotten Hero of New
              York's Slave Railway," "Local Song Writing in the Catskills," and "A Quest for
              American Roots." Also of interest is an early draft of <emph render="italic">Folk
                Songs of the Catskills</emph> entitled <emph render="italic">Music of the
                Catskills</emph> and a final typescript draft of <emph render="italic">Folk Songs of
                the Catskills</emph>, a collaborative projected compiled and edited by Norman
              Cazden, Herbert Haufrecht, and Norman Studer.</p>

            <p>The Diaries and Travelogues subseries consists primarily of travelogues documenting
              several school field trips and family vacations. The diaries document aspects of
              Studer's personal landscape, and were kept sporadically.</p>

          <p>The Subject Files series is an accumulation of material representing Studer's two
            primary interests: folklore and progressive education. Materials include notes,
            reprints, typescripts, news clippings, bound newspapers, journals, and writings of
            others. Of particular interest is a master's thesis by Marilyn Kimball entitled <emph render="italic">George Edwards: Catskill Folksinger</emph>. There is a typescript copy
            of "Merry Ditties: A Collection of Delectable Songs" from various traditional sources
            and a reprint of "Catskill Lockup Songs," both by Norman Cazden. Also located in this
            series is a copy of Herbert Haufrecht's "Woodland Serenade." There are three bound
            volumes of <emph render="italic">The New Student</emph>, a student run newspaper
            published and printed out of New York City during the 1920s and edited by Studer prior
            to his entering Columbia University.</p>
