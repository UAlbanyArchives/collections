      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains archived versions of the University website, dating back to 1997. Currently, the website is one of the main methods of delivery for news and information about the University. It contains the webpages of academic departments, administrative offices, and student groups. Content includes course and curricular information, University news updates, University publications, photographs, admissions information, and other information relating to the day-to-day functions of the University. Documents in the web archives include a variety of formats ranging from simple HTML documents, PDFs, and images, to more complex web documents containing embedded video and audio content, forms, and other common features.</p>
      <p>The completeness of each website snapshot varies. The daily crawls of the University website collect a limited number of documents, whereas the monthly crawls collect as many documents as possible in a 5 day period. As a result, the amount of information available from a given day may be limited, so specific web pages may not be represented as comprehensively as others.</p>
